    <p>If you are a Michael Caine fan, or like brit movies, or just generally like good old movies (or were young when it was released), you've probably seen the original Alfie, tale of a Jack The Lad character who cares only for himself and slowly becomes aware of the hurt this causes those around him.
Of course, the original is now too old to make any proper bank, so it's time to take a good idea and apply a thick layer of shiny mediocrity and remake it; and so they have, with Jude Law as a modern Alfie.
Law has the charm to pull off the kind of character Alfie is supposed to be, but I felt the film generally was quite hollow. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it didn't feel like it offered very much in the latter stages of the film - Alfie is learning the errors of his ways, but I just didn't care very much.
Also, the wardrobe people need firing, Alfie didn't have a single suit that was actually big enough for him. Your arms shouldn't bulge out wider than the shoulder pads!</p>
