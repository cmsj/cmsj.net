    <p>I've just published https://github.com/cmsj/HotMic/ which contains a very good amount of a macOS app I had hoped to complete and sell for a couple of bucks on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>However, I failed to get it working, primarily because I don't know enough of CoreAudio to get it working, and because I burned almost all of the time I had to write the app, fighting with things that, it turns out, were never going to work.</p>
<p>So, chalk that one up to experience I guess. Maybe the next person who has this idea will find my repo and spend their allotted time getting it to work :)</p>
<p>For the curious, the app's purpose was to be a Play Through mechanism for OS X. What is a Play Through app? It means the app reads audio from one device (e.g. a microphone or a Line In port) and writes it out to a different device (e.g. your normal speakers). This lets you use your Mac as a very limited audio mixer. I want it so the Line Out from my PC can be connected to my iMac - then all of my computer audio comes out of one set of speakers with one keyboard volume control setup.</p>
<p>For the super curious, I'd be happy to get back to working on the app if someone who knows more about Core Audio than I do, wants to get involved!</p>
