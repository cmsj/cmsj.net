    <p>Something that I've consistently failed at previously is uploading new translation templates in a timely fashion before a release. The translation community is absolutely fantastic and I want to make the best use of them that we possibly can, so beginning now I'm making more of a focus on regularly uploading templates to allow these multi-lingual rockstars enough time to make sure that the next release of Terminator has as much coverage as possible in your favourite language.</p>

    <p>One of the nice side effects of being at an Ubuntu Developer Summit is the interesting conversations you have with people outside of the sessions themselves (which, as a sysadmin present to support the event itself, I was not particularly involved in).
One such conversation was over lunch in a busy Google canteen with Kees Cook, one of our rocking security engineers and a thoroughly decent chap. After a while we came to the subject of Terminator and some of the features we'd like to implement, the ones that have been requested and we're not particularly motivated to work on, and the odd ones.
I was trying to remember the things people have asked us to add, that for one reason or another we probably aren't going to and mentioned one about the ability to navigate between terminals in a directional way: That is, rather than doing Ctrl-Tab to cycle through the terminals in the order they were created, you could press something to move to the terminal to the left, or above, right or below the currently focussed one.
On the surface it sounds like a good idea and probably not too tricky, but only if you think from the point of view of a grid. That really would be easy, but our UI is produced by way of a tree structure, not a grid. This means you need to do some proper thinking to figure it out. Kees' face lit up and he said something like "that sounds like a graph theory problem!" and expressed an interest in working on it.
I'm very glad to say that in just under a week after we all went home from UDS, I've just merged his results into trunk.
Thanks very much to Kees for his code and helpful suggestions (such as resurrecting Marcus Korn's simultaneous-typing branch, which I did one evening at UDS - rewriting it and then merging it into trunk). Also thanks to the other Terminator users I met there :)
So that's two new features, although not really the big ticket ones that are holding back 1.0 ;)</p>

    <p>Being a sysadmin I tend to install operating systems quite often on various bits of hardware. This means a lot of CDs. I carry at least 4 CDs in my laptop sleeve and that's not really enough, plus I sometimes burn CDs to update firmwares in laptops, etc.
It doesn't sound like the end of the world, because it's not, but that doesn't mean the status quo is worth keeping. I've been thinking for a while now that it would be great to have a solid-state device I could use as a USB CDROM. I could load it up with a bunch of ISOs and boot from them without having to carry round a load of CDs or waste blank CDs for BIOS/firmware upgrades that are only a few MB.
A little research showed that, as ever, Linux was the perfect candidate because of its USB Gadget subsystem, which lets it act as USB Mass Storage, USB Ethernet, USB Serial, USB MIDI and other things.
While the Mass Storage support currently in the kernel doesn't include CDROM support, there is <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-04-usb/usb-g_file_storage-add-cd-rom-emulation.patch" title="g_file_storage CD-ROM patch">a patch</a> kicking around which adds it as an option when loading the g_file_storage kernel module.
Next up - selecting some suitable hardware to test this on.
<img alt="Atmel NGW100" src="http://www.avr32linux.org/twiki/pub/Main/ModifyTheNGW100/ngw_overview.png">
<a href="http://www.atmel.no/" title="Atmel">Atmel</a>'s <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4102">NGW100</a> ticks all of the boxes for a test rig, it's got a serial port, a USB port, a power port and an MMC card slot. It's much bigger than a gumstix, and not powered by USB (although there is a<a href="http://nickstallman.net/node/11">dubious sounding hardware hack</a> for this), but this is a low cost board to prove the project is possible.
The board comes with linux pre-installed, but the kernel isn't super-new, and since the CD-ROM patch isn't in mainline yet, I needed to get the board up to date.
Fortunately there is a great community of people around embedded linux. With a bunch of googling and help from HcE on #elinux, last night I got stuck in and built a toolchain, kernel, root image and upgraded <a href="http://www.atmel.no/buildroot/buildroot-u-boot.html">the bootloader</a>. This morning I <a href="http://support.atmel.no/knowledgebase/avr32studiohelp/com.atmel.avr32.tool.ngw100/html/firmware_upgrade.html#With_serial_link">uploaded a new image</a> with a slightly old version of the CD-ROM patch (because I only just found the newer version while writing this post).
There's also plenty of information around about this, but it can be a challenge to wade into a brand new system and immediately know the right places to look (the <a href="http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view">avr32linux.org wiki</a> turns out to be supremely useful, as was HcE).
So the question is, does it work? The simple anwer is yes, a Linux machine sees it as a CD-ROM drive and can mount it as such. The more complex, and slightly worse answer is not yet, because a test against a BIOS didn't work. It's possible this is a <a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/wiki/index.php/VBUS_fix">hardware issue</a>, but it could be a software issue too, so I'm casting around for ideas :)
(the name "juicyD" is probably temporary, and I noticed about 6 hours after I chose it that someone <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/archives/2007/06/03/transcoding-video-for-the-ps3-in-ubuntu/#comment-56">commented</a> on an earlier post with that nick a while ago. Weird)</p>

  <div class="article__text">
    <p>It seems like I have failed utterly to comment on the towering totem of raw awesome that was the Foo Fighters concert on a balmy Saturday in June.
To put the event in context, I spent a few hours during the day with Rike, Alex and Simon in Hyde Park at the Red Bull Flügtag. We ate, we drank, we watched ridiculous people flinging themselves from a raised platform into The Serpentine in craft that almost invariably were capable solely of an ungraceful and undignified plunge. The notable exception being a poor attempt at a basic hangglider design, which somehow stalled and dived its way to a distance record.
We then said goodbye to Alex and headed half way across London toWembley Stadium, where we arrived to a bigger queue for the toilet than for the gates, so we were inside in a jiffy. We'd missed the support acts nonsense and things were gearing up for the Foos. It was a pretty impressive sight and sound to walk out onto what would normally be the pitch, amongst an almost capacity crowd (Dave Grohl seemed to think there were 86,000 people there).
Then noise, then cheering, then rock. Twenty minutes of rock go by before they take so much as a beat of a break to say hello. More rocking. Rock. Rockity rock. Rock. Special appearance by Jimmy Paige and John Paul Jones from Led Zepplin. Rock. Good night. Massive firework show.
Best gig I've ever been to, and I'm not expecting it to ever be beaten.
I would describe the show in more detail, but if you weren't there then you lose, sorry.
Except you don't lose! You can now buy a DVD or a Bluray of the show, and I am here to tell you that you absolutely should, especially if you own a Bluray player.
My copy of the Bluray arrived yesterday and I've watched the entire 2 hour show twice so far. There seem to be cameras everywhere and they're edited together well, so it's a treat to watch. The show was presented in conjunction with BBC Radio One and they broadcast it, so the sound recording is very good. What else do you care about? There are no extras, but who cares.
As if the weekend hadn't offered up enough excitement already, Simon and I went to Silverstone on the Sunday to see a day of Renault motorsport.</p>

    <p>I am lazy. There's no denying it, it's simple fact.
That means, for example, when I am working with pygtk and I look at the API for pynotify, I am sad, because it's a polling API and I hate polling.
What I like is GTK's event model. I like telling it what to run when things happen and letting it take care of all the pain for me. Obviously it's possible to write some code which will do the polling and then trigger an event, but that compromises my freedom to be lazy.
Step in pygobject, which contains the bindings for GIO. Within the bowels of this beastie are the required components to monitor a file for changes in a very few lines of python:</p>

<p>That's it. I don't know what the "unknown" argument for the callback is, probably the optional user_data connect() argument and this is but a small part of what inotify/GIO can do, but if you just care about being told when a file is updated, it'll do (with caveats that you can never really know when a file has finished being changed, so be careful to validate it before you trust its contents).</p>

    <p>If you're playing with the excellent new <em>ChrootDirectory</em> and <em>internal-sftp</em> options in recent OpenSSH releases (such as 5.1 which is in Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid), you may have hit an error like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fatal</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bad</span> <span class="n">ownership</span> <span class="n">or</span> <span class="n">modes</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">chroot</span> <span class="n">directory</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You may also have searched on Google for what to do about it and come away with very little useful information.
Well no more! I did the same thing and got bored of reading mailing list posts, so read the source code instead. The relevant section is in <em>session.c</em>:
        if (stat(component, &amp;st) != 0)
          fatal("%s: stat(\"%s\"): %s", <strong>func</strong>,
              component, strerror(errno));
        if (st.st_uid != 0 || (st.st_mode &amp; 022) != 0)
          fatal("bad ownership or modes for chroot "
              "directory %s\"%s\"",
              cp == NULL ? "" : "component ", component);</p>
<p>This is quite simple really, it's <em>stat()</em>ing the directory specified for "<em>ChrootDirectory</em>" and <strong>all its parents up to /</strong> and checking that they are:
-   owned by <em>root</em>
-   not <em>group</em> or <em>other</em> writable
-   (it also checks they are actually directories, but I'm going to assume you're not stupid enough to try and chroot into a file ;)</p>
<p>Note my emphesis that these checks apply to the chroot directory itself and its parents and <em>/</em>, so if you are chrooting users into /srv/chroot/ then you need to ensure that <em>/</em>, <em>/srv</em> and <em>/srv/chroot</em> are owned by root and not writable by the group (even if it's root, bizarrely) or other users.
Sorted.</p>

    <p>I have a laptop with some USB stuff built in. Some devices (such as Bluetooth) can be made to entirely disappear from the USB bus, however, the fingerprint reader and webcam can't, but they sit on the USB bus and draw power.
Fortunately the USB specs allow devices to be put to sleep if they're not being used and support that feature. Unfortunately many devices advertise they support it when they really don't, so Linux is unable to automatically put every USB device to sleep.
Fortunately you can control the setting by hand, and this is how. Firstly, start off with a Terminal and run the command "lsusb":</p>
<p><code>cmsj@kodachi:~$ lsusbBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 002 Device 002: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint ReaderBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 004 Device 002: ID 17ef:4807 LenovoBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hubBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hubcmsj@kodachi:~$</code>
You can ignore the "<em>root hub</em>" entries, the interesting two are "<em>SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader</em>" (guess which device that is ;), and "<em>Lenovo</em>" (this is the webcam).
So now we need to poke at those devices to enable their autosleeping. If we look at the entry for the webcam:</p>
<p>Bus 004 Device 002: ID 17ef:<strong>4807</strong> Lenovo</p>
<p>I've highlighted "<em>4807</em>". This is the Product value for this USB device (if you're curious, the "<em>17ef</em>" part is the Vendor value and uniquely identifies the maker of this device).
Now we need to find out where abouts the webcam lives in the <em>/sys/</em> filesystem (which is something the kernel provides to give applications lots of information about the hardware in your system).
The following command will put us on the right path:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>grep 4807 /sys/devices/*/*/usb*/*/idProduct
</pre></div>


<p>Which, on my laptop, returns:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/idProduct:4807
</pre></div>


<p>Take that information you get, and chop the "<em>idProduct:4807</em>" bit off the end, just leaving "<em>/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/</em>" (yours will look a little different to this) and add "<em>power/level</em>" to the end.
You should now have something that looks pretty much like "<em>/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level</em>" and if you get the current setting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cmsj@kodachi:~/Desktop$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level
on
cmsj@kodachi:~/Desktop$
</pre></div>


<p>you can see it is "on", which means it will not be automatically put to sleep. To change that, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo &quot;auto&quot; | sudo tee /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level
</pre></div>


<p>and test if your device still works (so if it's a webcam, fire up "<em>cheese</em>", or if it's a fingerprint scanner that you use, test if it still accepts your finger). If everything is good then you can put something in /etc/rc.local so the power saving will be set up every time you reboot your computer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo &quot;auto&quot; &gt; /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level
</pre></div>


<p>and that's it! Repeat this for all the USB devices in your laptop and enjoy the power saving (run "<em>powertop</em>" about 10 minutes before you start doing this so it has time to get a good average of your power usage, then see how much difference this makes. It could be up to 0.5Watts per device). Note that this won't work particularly well for external USB devices you plug in, becuase the /sys/ path won't exist until you plug the device in, so you'd need to do the above steps every time you connect it.
Hopefully HAL will start whitelisting devices which can be suspended, but I don't know of any work in this direction at the moment.</p>

    <p>In one word: wow.
Out of sheer curiosity last night I fired up the excellent <em>powertop</em> and decided to see how my system was doing. It was producing a couple of hundred fewer interrupts per second than it did in 8.04 (Hardy), and was using 1-2Watts less power.
Previously I have always resisted applying tweaks to my laptop that would attempt to reduce power, but since things were improving, the temptation was simply too great and I started digging out all the resources on this (by far the most useful being the tips on Intel's grammatically horrific <a href="http://www.lesswatts.org/">http://www.lesswatts.org/</a>. I had two reasons for not doing this previously - firstly I didn't want to deviate too much from a default install of Ubuntu (if only because it makes it much harder to reproduce bugs), but secondly I kept running into little weirdnesses. The most inconvenient of these was enabling AHCI link power management (which basically puts the hard disk bus to sleep when there is no IO); Enabling this and then suspending the laptop produced a 5 second delay on resuming because the kernel was forgetting it had put the bus to sleep and so had to wait for it to time out and be reset.
This particular niggle is fixed in 2.6.27 and so my 3-4 second resume times are preserved and I can save power! \o/
After a little while tweaking disk, AHCI, USB, filesystem, wireless, sound and ethernet options I ended up with a system which runs between 8 and 9 Watts when idle, down from 10-14 Watts, which I think is a pretty impressive saving and I'm very curious to find out from other Thinkpad X300 owners how well Windows performs in the power usage stakes - we always hear that Linux is a bit worse, but I'd be really quite surprised if the machine can run with very much less - it's spending (when idle, obviously) 99% of its time in the deepest processor sleep state and is only generating about a hundred interrupts per second (about 70-80% of which are due to my using a 3D desktop and wireless).</p>
