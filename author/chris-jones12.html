    <p><strong>Update:</strong> It has been suggested that it is not productive or collaborative to talk negatively about some developers releasing software for unixy operating systems without really trying to integrate it with the versions of widely deployed software available in those operating systems.
It is a fair point. It's not productive or collaborative. It may be true, but ranting about it doesn't help anyone but me.
More productive and collaborative would be to nicely ask these ISVs to establish a less isolated packaging process with our communities and companies (but I don't mean LSB or a new package format). Clearly some people won't work with them on ethical grounds, but a more pragmatic position will accept that commercial software exists, so it might as well not make our lives unnecessarily hard. And the companies shifting Linux are hot on ISVs.
Jorge: No, I don't like having multiple JVMs, but I have been in corporate situations before where it has been necessary because specific applications have required different versions :(</p>

    <p>There's no doubting that the iphone is a hugely capable machine. It's powerful yet easy to use, but it's not perfect. Here are some things which I think are missing:
* DAAP - it would be great to be able to play music via wifi since the thing is a bit low on storage.
* Background apps - I understand the huge problems implied by this, but certain apps could be blessed with the ability. Either that or the excellent last.fm client should be integrated with the iPod app. Not everything can be made a push app (the api for which isn't even available yet)
* IMAP subscriptions - I have loads of mail folders I don't want to see, which is dead easy in most mail clients, because of the ability to only subscribe to certain mailboxes. I would like to see this in the iPhone mail client.
* IMAP new mail checking - I don't have all my new mail go to my inbox, some gets filtered to other folders an I would like to be able to tell the mail client to check these too.</p>

    <p>Still liking this excellent toy. I have now had most of the commonly seen bugs, and a couple of crashes, which sucks, but my N95 was pretty unstable too, and not even slightly as nice!</p>

    <p>I picked up an iPhone a couple of days ago, and other than having to replace it already because the button didn't work properly, I really like it. I'm writing this from a wordpress app on it.
Mostly it means I have a decent web browser in my pocket. Rock.</p>

    <p>It's been far too long, but here it is. Terminator 0.9.
As usual, head over to the <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/" title="Terminator Home Page">home page</a> to get all the links and information you need.
"So what's new in this release?" Well let's have a little look at the ChangeLog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tab support</li>
<li>Drag &amp; Drop support</li>
<li>Added support for ~/.config/terminator/config</li>
<li>Switch the meanings of "horizontal" and "vertical" wrt splitting, after extensive user feedback. Added context menu icons to try and make the meaning clearer.</li>
<li>Added keybindings for terms size and scrollbar manipulation. Thanks Emmanuel Bretelle.</li>
<li>Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible defaults if not, and can be overridden entirely by ~/.config/terminator/config</li>
<li>Support terminal zooming - now you can quickly hide all terminals apart from one and either scale the fontsize or not.</li>
<li>New application icon from Cory Kontros</li>
<li>FreeBSD support (thanks to Thomas Hurst)</li>
<li>and a whole heap of bug fixes. Rock on!</li>

    <p>It's taken us some time to get there, but as <a href="https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/0.9" title="Bugs milestoned for 0.9">this page</a> shows, we now have all of the bugs we want solved for 0.9, solved :D
The string freeze came way too late unfortunately, so I'm expecting we'll want to do a 0.9.1 consisting of translations and fixes for any other bugs we figure out on <a href="https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/1.0-beta" title="Bugs milestoned for 1.0">the road to 1.0</a>.
I now need to prepare all of the parts required for a release and push out a final RC build into <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive" title="Terminator PPA">our PPA</a> and if all is well, 0.9 will be released very shortly! Please test it now and tell us if you hit any last minute problems.</p>

    <p>The list of milestone bugs is now clear of items which affect the UI, so we are now in string freeze. I uploaded a new POT for 0.9 so the wonderful, wonderful community of translators can weave their magic. We did have a small false start which required changing one string, but unless anyone shakes out any new bugs, that's it. 0.9 is one step closer to release.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/0.9" title="Terminator 0.9 Milestone bugs">list of bugs</a> left for Terminator 0.9 is getting shorter (although I do keep failing to resist the temptation to add more) and so it's time to try and get some wider testing.
Therefore, we've started uploading beta packages of 0.9 to our PPA. If you want to help test and you run Ubuntu, add this apt source:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">deb</span> <span class="s">http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome-terminator/ubuntu</span> <span class="kp">hardy</span> <span class="kp">main</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you have Terminator installed already from a package, it should then be offered to you as an upgrade, otherwise run:
<code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install terminator</code>
Please report any bugs you find to <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/%20" title="Terminator Bugs @ Launchpad">http://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/</a> and please feel free to drop by #terminator on irc.freenode.net with any feedback!</p>
