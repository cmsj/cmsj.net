    <p>The title says it all really. I've banged on about games a bit and now it's time to do something involving curiosity!
So I know how to, should i want to for any reason, this is how you can make videos that are playable on a PS3 (only tested on firmware 1.80). Note that it doesn't transcode to H.264, but instead uses a lesser MPEG4 profile of some kind (mpeg4 appears to be entirely too complicated to figure out!).
This mostly comes from <a href="http://po-ru.com/diary/bleeding-edge-ffmpeg-on-ubuntu-feisty/">here</a>, but the gist is that you grab a specific version of ffmpeg from SVN and compile it against a variety of media libraries from multiverse. This makes me think ubuntu should have a bleeding edge version of ffmpeg in multiverse that links against the libraries there - if licences allow for it.
For what it's worth, this is the command line I've been using with it (note that it will strip surround audio down to 2 channel stereo. That's all i have, so I haven't bothered to figure out anything better).
<code>ffmpeg -y -i /path/to/source.avi -acodec aac -ab 192kb -vcodec mpeg4 -b 1500kb -mbd 2 -flags +4mv+trell -aic 2 -cmp 2 -subcmp 2 -title "Blah 2: The blahing" /path/to/output.mp4</code></p>

    <p>For those who don't know me on IRC, I go by <code>Ng</code> there, and I claim that the following log is the greatest IRC conversation that has ever taken place.</p>

<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>let me stick my proboscis in to this conversation.

<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span><span class="na">lilyj:</span> nothing at all, he&#39;s lion

<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span><span class="na">cdavies:</span> it would have rammed the pun home
<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>If I can&#39;t think up a good pun soon, I may have to fall back on a meer cat joke.
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>but ewe missed it
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>what an ass!
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>he should have mule&#39;d it over more.
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span><span class="na">cdavies:</span> If you had responded to &quot;he&#39;s lion&quot; with &quot;he&#39;s not lion, he&#39;s a meerkat&quot; you could have even gotten a rimshot
<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>I didn&#39;t want to hog the glory.
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>I&#39;m sure one of us would have swined about it
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>But we&#39;ve no need to ham i tup
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>probably not.  we&#39;re too busy putting on hares
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>and steaking our own claims
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>steering each other in wrong directions
<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>owl come right out and say it, this coversation makes me want to shriek and run out to the barn.
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>a rather mousey response
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>we do hawk bad puns :(
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>It&#39;s getting harder to ferret them out, though
<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>maybe it&#39;s time to clam up then.
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span><span class="na">cdavies:</span> I think you&#39;re just being shellfish
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span><span class="na">lilyj:</span> you&#39;d better krill him!
<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>don&#39;t mount him though, he&#39;s been known to humpback.
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span><span class="na">cdavies:</span> not if she starts whaling on you
<span class="nt">    &lt;cdavies&gt; </span>yeah, squid pro quo for putting up with your puns.

<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>he wolfs them down
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>damn, this conversation is just beastly
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>it has a tendency to dragon though...
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>maybe we could sire a new one
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>if everyone is done horsing around, that is...
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>you&#39;re such a cheetah
<span class="nt">    &lt;lilyj&gt; </span>you&#39;re going to have have to pony up an explanation for that accusation
<span class="nt">    &lt;koudelkat&gt; </span>that wasnt stipulated in the rider agreement

    <p>I picked up the latest Hybrid album recently, called I Choose Noise. It's outstanding, if you are a fan of Hybrid you will definitely like it. If not, go and listen to them on last.fm or something and then go buy the albums!
In the process of faffing around again with music libraries and ripping CDs and rhythmbox I found myself quite irritated that I couldn't control my music from my laptop (which I use more than my desktop these days), so I installed Music Player Daemon (mpd) and then a gnome client for it on my laptop. It rocks! The client UI could use some love, but it's fully capable of playing music, which is what I wanted :)</p>

It's just something of a shame that I didn't actually mean to buy this particular model of LinkSys wireless thingy. Never mind, I'm sure I'll find a use for it :)</p>

    <p>It's always kinda annoyed me when applications waste space with lots of menu bars and toolbars and stuff, when they could be using the space to show me useful stuff, or just be smaller.
I appreciate that lots of people don't want information as densely packed as I do, but that's clearly not going to stop me trying. Up until now it's not been enough of an issue to do anything about, because I've had at least one big monitor for quite some time now.
However, since I recently got a very portable laptop which only does 1024x768, my mind has been mulling over ways to save as much screen space as possible.
With that in mind, I've collapsed down as much stuff as I can and present two screenshots, firstly of <a href="http://www.pointlessrubbish.net/waishou-2006-12-06-firefox.png">my firefox workspace</a> and secondly of <a href="http://www.pointlessrubbish.net/waishou-2006-12-06-thunderbird.png">my thunderbird one</a>. All the gnome stuff I care about is packed into one little toolbar at the top and since I always run these apps with the windows maximised, I use devilspie to strip the window borders. My main workspace just has four terminals at the maximum sizes they can be (which works out at about 82x29 with small fonts).
Finally, as a challenge, can anyone suggest ways to save even more screen space?</p>

    <p>Over the weekend I was at Eastnor Castle with a bunch of friends for The Big Chill, a fantastic little music festival that happens every August. It's nice and small (I reckon about 30,000 people) and very friendly, with lots of very cool bands playing (mostly ones I haven't heard of, which is nice).
I expect some pictures will appear sooner or later, but in the mean time, sucks to be all of you that didn't go! ;)</p>

    <p><em>Note: This post is a work-in-progress, I will probably come back to this and change/update/rewrite it at will</em>
I picked up a ThinkPad x40 recently to use with Dapper and I thought I'd chuck up a few notes from my experience thus far. I deliberately chose the ThinkPad because of the reputation of IBM's laptops and especially that they use very good hardware and it has to be said that on a modern distro, especially one that aims to work well with laptops, almost every bit of hardware works straight away after install. I would seriously recommend <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/">ThinkWiki</a> to anyone attempting ThinkPad/Linux shenanigans - they have a huge amount of information about the various bits of hardware, installation guides, tips and a bunch more, all nicely tagged so you can tell which bits are relevant to the machine you own.
First off I'll run through some of the key steps of installation.
1. Before doing anything else, I used the IBM tools in the pre-installed Windows XP to produce restore images and burn them to disc (one CD, one DVD). This is mostly a precaution in case I either have some insurmountable problem with Linux on the machine, or if I ever come to sell it and the buyer wants their licenced copy of Windows.
2. After that I did a pretty much default install of Ubuntu. If you want to, you can set the BIOS to disable protection for the "hidden" IBM recovery partition, then use the whole disk in the Ubuntu installer. I chose to leave it there, but I may reclaim it at some point in the future. I read on a few pages/forums that suspending seems to be more reliable if you add <code>acpi_sleep=s3_bios</code> to the kernel command line, which is easy to do in Ubuntu. Edit <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code> (you can use <code>gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst</code> if you don't know otherwise) and place the above acpi_sleep option on the end of the <code>kopt=</code> line and running <code>sudo update-grub</code>.
3. With the install done I set about installing a few bits and pieces to make the laptop more useful - things like Network Manager (so it's trivially easy to join wired/wireless networks from the desktop), various Bluetooth tools (install <code>gnome-bluetooth</code> and you get most of the bits you need), Java (<code>sun-java5-plugin</code>), mplayer, a few other multimedia libraries including Real Player (available, along with Opera, in the Add/Remove tool (see the Applications menu) if you enable the commercial repository).
4. Start testing things - graphics work fine, wireless works fine with the madwifi driver (although there is some possibility that there is a kernel crashing bug in the version Dapper offers, see LaunchPad <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15/+bug/37773">bug 37773</a>), wired ethernet is great, keyboard keys mostly seem to work (volume controls work by default, which is a nice touch).
5. Configure it. The first thing I did was disable the Sound Server Daemon in Gnome (called Esound, or <code>esd</code>) because I really dislike it. I then stripped out all the interfaces from <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> other than <code>lo</code> so that Network Manager will take responsibility.
6. Tweak things. Mplayer always works better if you add an entry to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> that says <code>dev/rtc/max-user-freq=1024</code> and the ThinkPad's wireless activity LED can be enabled with <code>dev/ath0/softled=1</code>. I fiddled with the settings in the Power Management options in Preferences, but these are personal choices, so I won't bother listing them. One thing I would recommend is setting it to only show an icon when it is charging or discharging - if you're on AC and the battery is full you don't really need an icon, so you get a few extra pixels of panel space (and because the screen is small I'd recommend ditching the lower panel and moving its applets to the top). On the subject of applets and screen estate, you can replace the "Applications Places System" menus with a single "Main Menu" applet, which shows an ubuntu logo on the panel - click on it and you get the Applications menu, with Places and System tacked onto it. Gnome's sensors applet can read the information provided by the <code>ibm-acpi</code> driver, so you can monitor the temperature of various bits of hardware and fan speeds. Also of some interest is the CPU Frequency Scaling applet (which shows you how much Linux is throttling your CPU when its idle). One final Gnome panel tip is that if you make it 25 pixels tall instead of the default 24, larger windows will get their window manager icons shown in the Workspace switcher applet. A trivial little detail, but it's kinda handy if (like me) you tend to run things fullscreen on their own workspace.</p>

    <p>A couple of years older, a couple of years wiser, I saw <a href="http://www.uglyduckling.us/">Ugly Duckling</a> again at the Jazz Cafe in cheery old Camden Town recently. Last time they were <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ugly+Duckling/Taste+the+Secret">Meat Shakin'</a>, but this time they had <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ugly+Duckling/Bang+for+the+Buck">Bang for The Buck</a> which is a really sweet album and makes for some very cool live performance.
The venue is kinda small so it's *very* cosy, but the only people at UD gigs seem to be all other UD fans, so everyone is having a shitload of fun and is ignoring the inevitable game of "guess the body part" ;)
From a weird, observational point of view, the typical demographic this time was older and more suburban than last time, which is...as I said, weird.
If you're not familiar with UD, head to their site (link above) and it will play a track. Reload for another. Realise you want the rest ;)</p>
