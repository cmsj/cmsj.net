    <p>I've been up to things again and finally got around to putting the pictures up.
<img alt="Jazz Cafe Picnic" src="http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/2005_08_14-Jazz_Cafe_Picnic/thumb_dsc00120.jpg">To kick things off we have a gallery of photos from the Jazz Cafe Picnic at Marble Hill in Twickenham (London). It can be found <a href="http://gallery.tenshu.net/thumbnails.php?album=32">here</a>.
<img alt="Science Museum" src="http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/2005_08_24-Science_museum/thumb_img_0137.jpg">On Tuesday I went to London to meet up with adie and we wandered around the Science Museum, saw a 3D IMAX movie and looked round an exhibition of costumes/props from the Hitchhiker's Guide movie. The gallery is <a href="http://gallery.tenshu.net/thumbnails.php?album=31">here</a>.
Finally, as a bit of fun, I found myself in some TV footage from Glastonbury (click on the images for larger and fullsize versions):
<a href="http://gallery.tenshu.net/displayimage.php?album=4&amp;pos=4"><img alt="Me at Glastonbury" src="http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_glasto2005-royksopp.jpg"></a> <a href="http://gallery.tenshu.net/displayimage.php?album=4&amp;pos=3"><img alt="Me at Glastonbury (captioned)" src="http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_glasto2005-royksopp-named.jpg"></a>
On the left is the original TV image with us circled, on the right is the same shot, but with us magnified (or rather, the back of our heads magnified)</p>

The man can certainly express some righteous anger!
It wasn't all political ranting (which was still very funny), there was a good mix of humour, some of which went beyond the pale for some of the audience; Along with some excellent anecdotes from various anarchic protests he has taken part in.
Two thumbs up :)</p>

  <div class="article__text">
    <p>I just upgraded to a k750i from a t610 and my initial impression after a few days is that it's a very good phone overall. It's not perfect, but it many of the weaknessesof the t610 are gone or minimised, and new features have been added and integrated extremely well.
Visually the phone is quite simple, I have a mostly black one and half of the front is flat clear plastic for the screen, the rest is buttons, which are bigger than those on the t610, but seem like they are quite flimsy and may be easily encouraged to fall off. Time will have to tell on that.
The phone has plenty of hardware, too much really. There's a much more detailed display than on the t610, mp3 playback, fm radio, movie playback, movie recording, flash, autofocus... it's all a bit much really. I already have two digital cameras for different occasions, I don't really need a 2 MegaPixel camera in my phone; I do realise that these are "useful" to a lot of people though ;) The shortcut button between the two soft buttons is very nice, being able to quickly pull up the functions you most use can save a lot of menu diving. The thing has a MemoryStick Duo slot too, which is a genius plan really. If you don't already have a little digital camera to keep in your pocket and a little mp3 player to keep in your other pocket, this phone can realistically do the job of both, and save you having a third pocket used by your phone. The Duo cards are pretty cheap and I have seen suggestion that it can support up to 2GB (mine shipped with a 64MB card pre-installed, in addition to the 30-somethingMB onboard). It also seems to have some kind of 3D graphics ability - my Orange branded unit shipped with a Sega tennis game that is in 3D and Alex's one on O2 came with a 3D flight sim of some kind (I don't mean crazy red and green specs, it is rendering a 3D engine ;)
The biggest improvement over the t610 and probably the best thing about this phone is the software. It's clearly based at least in concept on that of the t610 (which in turn in herits from the t68 and earlier), but it's much, much faster. Speed has often been a problem for SonyEricsson, text message inputs regularly lag a long way behind even a moderate typer. I was often several menus ahead of mine in general use, which is a serious pain. No more, menus appear much quicker and are able to use the higher screen resolution to display more information, reducing the number of questions you have to answer to perform even the simple task of calling someone. The phonebook is wonderful now; if you start typing it jumps to the letters you press instead of waiting a second; instead of selecting a person and then getting a request to select the number, it now displays the default number and offers a direct call option, then offers horizontal scrolling to select alternate numbers/addresses. Very handy. Also nice is the text message recipient chooser keeping a list of recent contacts.
The browser seems to work well, the menus/notices are often animated and pretty, you can have an animated background if you really want. The media player is quite an interesting idea, I am investigating transcoding movies and putting them on memory stick - it'll be interesting to see how the battery stands up to such tests.
The supplied USB cable charges the phone; <strong>very</strong> handy and it also presents the MemoryStick to the host computer as a USB storage device, so it will work with pretty much anything that works with USB memory sticks. It's bloody fantastic to see mobile phone and camera companies adopting this more and more instead of proprietary communication protocols. It makes integration far easier for Operating Systems, as shown by the fact that I connect the phone to my PC running Ubuntu Hoary and it is able to mount the storage drive and notice there is digital camera data there, and offering to import the photos into my albums. Simple things like that make these devices much more rewarding in my opinion (and I'm pretty sure I'm right ;)</p>

    <p>Woo! Ok, so the torrential rain and inches of mud were a bit of a pain, but didn't dampen many spirits and the festival was still a lot of fun :)
I saw some groovy acts play (Jools Holland, Van Morisson, Royksopp, etc.) and saw some funny sights (the guy in the tent near us who made a habit of walking around naked, for example) and generally communed with hippies for a few days.
I hope the 2007 festival is as good, if not better!

    <p>I forgot to mention that I saw The Chemical Brothers live recently. They're touring at the moment, so a few of us caught them at the Brighton Centre (not the best gig venue in the world ever, it has to be said). They rock a bunch :)
Up and coming musical happenings are my trips to Glastonbury and Big Chill festivals - expect lots of photos unless some pikey half-inches my camera ;)</p>

    <p>I'm quite a big fan of the Zend Studio development environment for PHP - I use it quite extensively at work and generally speaking it's a very capable tool and makes developing PHP a lot easier/quicker.
However, it's closed source and quite expensive, which is a bit of a downside, but at the same time it should give me some leverage to get the features I want into future versions, right? Probably not.
I've been bugging the Zend support guys about AMD64 support for near enough 10 months now, with little success. Now, this might not seem too surprising, what with it being closed source, but the important difference here is that Zend's Studio is written in <em>Java</em>.
Given that Java is supposed to be a platform agnostic virtual machine, precisely why is it that Zend only ship binaries for a few platforms? The answer appears to be that the installer they use to install said binaries on customer machines is a complete nightmare.
Specifically they appear to be using InstallAnywhere, which is becoming quite common for installing java programs, especially on Linux. Sadly it has some pretty serious flaws. Firstly it's one of those godawful self-extracting/installing shell scripts, so modifying the installer is exceptionally hard. It also knows almost nothing about AMD64, despite the fact that it ought to be really quite compatible with 32bit code (especially for something as library-free as java) and triggers a lovely glibc bug (set "<code>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5</code>" on an AMD64 machine and then try to run anything ;)
So basically that all sucks and anyone using InstallAnywhere is cutting themselves off from potential customers for no particularly good reasons. Obviously I can't accept that, so knowing that Zend Studio is really just a Java program I went at it with a copy of vim and a lot of scribbling notes until I figured out how InstallAnywhere's crazy LAX configuration system worked. With that out of the way I was able to determine that all you need to do to make this thing run *perfectly* on AMD64 is make two tiny changes to two not-so-tiny text files. Simple!
Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Zend Studio somewhere (a 32bit machine or a 32bit chroot), copy the folder to your 64bit install</li>
<li>Look in the directory Studio is installed in (e.g. "<code>/usr/local/Zend/ZendStudioClient-4.0.2/</code>") and edit "<code>bin/ZDE.lax</code>", you need to have "<code>lax.nl.current.vm</code>" point to your 64bit Java VM binary (e.g. "<code>/usr/bin/java</code>").</li>
<li>Now edit "<code>bin/ZDE</code>" and comment out the line "<code>export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5</code>"</li>
</ol>
<p>That should be it, fire up <code>bin/ZDE</code> and you should be hacking PHP in 64bits of goodness (be aware you may need to reconfigure where Zend Studio finds external binaries like cvs - see the ZDE configuration window).
<strong>Update</strong>
I've spoken with Zend since writing this and although they are still not committing to supporting AMD64, they did provide me with a handy link to download the Zend Studio installer without the 32bit JVM in it, which (with some work) makes a native 64bit install possible. Hurrah!
So, what to do, well firstly you will need the tarball (I'm not going to link to it, ask Zend) and to extract it. This should leave you with a single file called <code>ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin</code> (in the case of 4.0.2, current release at the time of writing). Run the command:
<code>cat ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin | sed -e 's/=2.2.5/=a.a.a/g' &gt;ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin.1</code>
Then run "<code>sh ./ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin.1</code>" and the installer should start. Once it has completed you still won't actually be able to start ZDE because the same LD_ASSUME nonsense is going on there, so edit "bin/ZDE". Above I showed the quick and hacky way to make this work - comment out the "<code>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5</code>" - however there is a way that is probably better, so I will encourage you to do this instead... Edit line 1326 so instead of reading simply:
<code>if [ `uname` = "Linux" ]; then</code>
it now reads:
<code>if [ `uname` = "Linux" -a `uname -m` != "x86_64" ]; then</code>
and all will be well :o)
<strong>Update 2</strong>
One thing I hadn't noticed because it was working transparently is that not all of ZDE is Java, for example the code analyzer binary in Zend's bin/ folder appears to be a native 32bit binary. These should still work fine if you have some 32bit compatibility libraries installed (Fedora should install these by default on AMD64, Debian based systems may need to install the ia32-libs package).</p>

In short, it rocked!
Format is a great DJ and Abdominal is a great rapper. D-Sisive was ok, but doesn't seem to be as good as Abdominal.
They played some tunes off their new album, "If you can't join em, beat em" as well as some classics from "Music for the Mature B-Boy", including a very funny version of Vicious Battle Raps with most of the lyrics reversed from the original.
There was a bunch of crowd interaction, including getting a guy to race against Abdominal; he had to eat a breadstick and then whistle in the same amount of time it took Abdominal to rap out 8 bars at full speed (which isn't very many seconds). Personally I think he lost, but they gave him the CD anyway ;)
If Format and friends are playing anywhere near you (click <a href="http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/63206/DJ_Format.html">here</a> to find out), you should go see them :)</p>

    <p>I have uploaded a mini HOWTO into my <a href="http://docs.tenshu.net/">techie documents</a> section that covers configuring a Linux machine running Xorg to make best possible use of a Logitech keyboard and mouse (the Elite and MX700 respectively) and the bundles they are sold together in (the Duo MX and Cordless Desktop MX).
It requires a fairly recent distro because it uses some features/data only available in Xorg so far. Personally I am using these settings without problems on my Ubuntu Hoary machine.
