    <p>Hot on the heels of 0.91 we have a new release for you. This is another bugfix release, stomping on as many regressions from 0.14 as we can find. Many, many thanks to all of the people who have been in touch with the project to tel us about the things that are affecting them. If you find more regressions/bugs, please let us know!
Also in this release the Palette section of the Profile editor in the Preferences GUI is now fully active, which means that all of the config file options should now be fully editable in the GUI.</p>

    <p>After lots of work we're really very proud to announce that the completely re-worked Terminator 0.90 is now available! Hopefully we haven't introduced too many new bugs in exchange for the much requested features of being able to save layouts!</p>

    <p>Ok folks, I suck for not getting Terminator 0.90 released earlier and I suck for not having a bunch of bug fixes for 0.14 in Ubuntu Lucid.
I'm going to fix both tonight by releasing 0.90 and begging the lovely Ubuntu Universe folks to grant an exception to get it into Lucid.
Here's hoping everything goes smoothly!</p>

    <p>For a while now I've been thinking about some ideas for a project that will require a scanner. No problem you think, scanners of various kinds have been supported in Linux for a long time.
I dislike ordering hardware online because of the shipping lag and because I'm a sucker for the retail experience, so I was checking out which devices would work with Ubuntu and which devices were on sale in my local computer supermarket. The latter was a depressingly short list, and the former was getting annoying to search for, but I stumbled on the idea of a multi-function printer. It turns out that it's cheaper to buy a scanner as part of a printer than it is to buy a scanner on its own (granted the resolution of the scanner isn't quite as good, but it's more than sufficient for my needs). The reason for this is undoubtedly that the manufacturers are expecting to make up their money by selling me ink cartridges every few months.
As I started to look at models of multi-function printers, one thing became apparent almost immediately - HP have done a lot of leg work on this. I quickly found a bunch of info on their site about how they basically support all of their stuff on Linux, including a page which specifically listed popular distros and which versions worked with which printers.
I decided pretty much immediately that I wanted to support this, so off I went to the shop to buy an HP. They had the decent looking F4580 for around £40, so I nabbed that and set off home.
When I got home I fired up my laptop running Lucid and plugged the new device in. Less than 10 seconds later I was told it was ready for printing, and I fired up Robert Ancell's excellent new Simple Scan to see what configuration I would need to do to make that work.... the answer being none, it scanned a page first time.
Now smug with the ease with which that had worked I started installing the HP driver software on a popular proprietary operating system so I could use it to configure the printer's WiFi feature (something I assumed I couldn't do from within Ubuntu - an assumption that turns out to have been wrong). Ten minutes later it was still finishing off the install process, but eventually I did get the printer hooked up to our wireless network.
Back to the Lucid machine, I told it to add a new printer, it immediately saw the HP announcing itself on the network and let me quickly add that and I could print over wifi. Pretty nifty stuff.
Then I started poking around with HP's Linux Imaging and Printing software (HPLIP) and noticed that there was an "hp-toolbox" that wasn't installed. This is the tool I should have used to configure the wifi network on the printer; It also shows the ink levels and lets you kick off scanning/printing/cleaning type jobs. Out of sheer curiosity I went into hp-toolbox's preferences and changed it from using xsane to simple-scan, and told it to start a Scan. I wasn't expecting it to work because the device wasn't connected via USB, but it turns out that not only does the device support scanning over WiFi, it works in Linux. It's not quite as fast as a direct hookup, but it's certainly significantly more convenient!
So there we have it, out of the box I was up and running within 10 seconds of plugging the device in, and if I'd known to just install hp-toolbox I would have had everything running wirelessly a few minutes later. This being compared to installing CDs and dealing with great gobs of driver/application mess (I've seen HP's Windows drivers and it's no fun trying to persuade them to update themselves, or to persuade them not to prompt you to register every week). A huge, epic victory for Linux and Ubuntu - and one that I seem to find with much random consumer hardware these days. A few years ago this post would have been full of complicated commands and scripts and compilation as I described how to make the device work, but now all I can do is be smug about how easy it was :D

    <p>We've been hard at work over the last 7 months preparing a whole new core for Terminator and it's getting close to being ready, so this is a beta release intended for testing only. Ubuntu packages have been uploaded to our test PPA (<a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive/test">https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive/test</a>) and a tarball is available from <a href="http://mairukipa.tenshu.net/~cmsj/terminator/">http://mairukipa.tenshu.net/~cmsj/terminator/</a>.
Please provide any feedback about this release to our bug tracker at <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/">https://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/</a> or our IRC channel, #terminator on irc.freenode.net.</p>
<p>Caveats:
  * config files from 0.14 and earlier are currently ignored by 0.90 because the config file format has changed.
  * we now have a very basic ability to save and restore layouts, but this feature is very new and likely to contain many bugs</p>

    <p>I'm done hacking on the Terminator epic-refactor branch for the evening and the following has been achieved today (in chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in handling URLs dropped on the window</li>
<li>Implement directional navigation</li>
<li>Implement geometry hinting</li>
<li>Fix a bug in group emitting that cause "Broadcast off" and "Broadcast to all" to become inverted</li>
<li>Implement WM_URGENT bell handler</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm <em>really</em> happy with how this is going. All that is left to have feature parity with trunk, I think, is some keyboard shortcut handlers.
I'd still love to get more testing results to make sure I haven't missed anything, but at this rate I'm expecting to be able to land the epic-refactor branch on trunk this weekend, after five and a half months.
Then I'm going to write a tool to convert old config files and we can think about putting out a 0.90 beta release. Exciting stuff!</p>

    <p>I managed to finish off what I thought were the last few missing keyboard shortcuts during my lunch break today, but then realised that I'd missed two, but I was so excited an short of time that I decided to just go ahead and land the branch anyway!
So there it is - trunk is now completely refactored and full of exciting new bugs. I noticed while I was working from it this afternoon that the transparency setting code wasn't working, but I expect I can get that cleared up tonight :)
Now a bunch of bug fixing and a config converter and we can release!
Thanks to everyone who has been testing so far.</p>

    <p>Further to my previous post I thought I'd post a quick update about how things are progressing. I mentioned in my previous post that I knew of several things that were not yet working in the Epic Refactor branch:</p>
<ul>
<li>-e and -x command line options</li>
<li>all forms of drag &amp; drop</li>
<li>directional navigation</li>
<li>some keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pleased to say that the first two of these are now taken care of, but the latter two are still to be done. I'm less pleased to say that I haven't had much external feedback about this branch yet, but I suspect that most people who might be interested probably don't read my blog ;)
So if you know people who like Terminator and enjoy testing things out, all they need to do is:
    bzr branch lp:~cmsj/terminator/epic-refactor
    cd epic-refactor
    ./terminator</p>
<p>and give some feedback!</p>

    <p>You might have seen my recent posts about the epic refactoring that has been going on in the Terminator codebase for the last few months.
I think it's finally time that we get some more eyeballs on it, mainly so I can check that I haven't massively screwed something up. I know there is lots of missing functionality right now, and probably a bunch of subtle bugs, but I could use your help quantifying exactly what these are!
If you're inclined to help, please branch <em>lp:~cmsj/terminator/epic-refactor</em>, cd into it and run <em>./terminator</em>, then use it like you always would and file bugs, preferably indicating clearly in the bug that you're using this branch and not trunk (maybe tag the bug '<strong>epicrefactor</strong>').
Things I know are broken right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>-e and -x command line options</li>
<li>all forms of drag &amp; drop</li>
<li>directional navigation</li>
<li>some keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I know are missing because they're not coming back:
-   Extreme tabs mode (sorry, it's just too insane to support)
-   GNOME Terminal profile reading (I'm trying to simplify our crazy config system and dropping GConf is a good way to achieve that)
-   Config file reading. At some point I'll write something that migrates old Terminator configs to the new format, but for now you'll have to live without your old config file. The new one isn't documented yet either, but it is a whole bunch better!</p>
<p>Now would also be a great time to start writing plugins for Terminator and telling me about them. I'm happy to ship good plugins, but more importantly I want feedback about the weaknesses/strengths of our plugin system. Right now you can only hook into URL mangling and the terminal context menu, but the latter of those gives you pretty serious flexibility I think. Obviously one massive weakness is a lack of documentation about the plugin API, but I'll get to that, I promise!
So there we have it, another step along the way to me being able to merge this branch into trunk and put out a real release of 0.90 and then eventually 1.0!</p>
