    <p>The tabs feature is in. drag&amp;dropping terminals is in. For bonus points we've even thrown in a branch that lets you quickly hide all the terminals apart from one (I'm experimentally calling this "terminal zooming").
So that's it for new features for 0.9 and apart from fixing bugs we are now only tweaking the existing features to get them right.
In the next week or so I'll declare a string freeze and get a translation template up so our fantastic translators can get to work while we take care of the final bugs. Right after that, a glorious 0.9 will roll out of the door and into a tarball/PPA/Intrepid near you!</p>

    <p>After learning to use Meld and much chatting with chantra, I'm pleased to announce that we have <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/terminator/trunk/revision/273">landed</a> his <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~chantra/terminator/dnd-tabs">dnd-tabs branch</a> into <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/">Terminator</a> <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/terminator/trunk">trunk</a>.
What does all of that mean? Well, it means that we are a major step closer to being able to release 0.9 (which I have arbitrarily decided should be released only when we have tab support). That's not to say that the release will be today or even in the next week - the branch landing may bring us all the infrastructure we need, but it needs some UI and behaviour love to make sure people don't get lost in a maze of nested tabs (although this seems like such a powerful feature for some users that it may well be available as an option). This is the sort of thing I want to avoid out of the box:
<img alt="Tab madness" src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/terminator-tabs.png">
One other nice thing we get from chantra's branch is drag&amp;drop re-ordering of terminals. You can kind of see it at work in the screenshot below - we highlight the area of the window where the terminal being dragged will end up (note that you can't see the mouse pointer - it should be over the grey square with a drag icon of a terminal):
<img alt="Drag and drop glory" src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/terminator-dnd.png">
Thanks very much to chantra for his hard work on this, and indeed all of the team who have been rocking trunk for weeks now. We'll get this polished and fixed ASAP and into a tarball/PPA and hopefully into things like Fedora and OpenSUSE :)</p>

    <p>It's a month since my last news item and since it's also now almost a month since Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) was released, work has picked up again on Terminator.
We're landing lots of fixes and architectural tweaks all the time, with a few features slipping in there too.</p>
<p>There's no firm deadline for 0.9 yet, but tabs is still the main blocking feature (drag&amp;drop terminal arranging will be included free with that, which is extremely nice).
The team continues to grow, and we're getting more and more blog coverage. Thanks to everyone involved!</p>

It's utterly outrageous that we have a law which supposedly prevents individuals from expressing their opinion.

even if you don't like that, there's:

so that covers every religion as a cult. As for dangerous - they have a well documented history of legal threats, intimidating behaviour, etc.

    <p>... neither of them good.
First off, in a stunning piece of fail, Lenovo have used a drive from one of the few manufacturers that enforces region coding on DVDs in hardware - Matshita, aka Matsushita, aka Panasonic. This is very frustrating and made worse by the drive shipping in a state with no region code set, so no DVDs at all will play. I now either have the choice of changing it no more than 5 times, or risking the drive with some custom firmware which claims to remove the region code.
Secondly, and more worryingly, there is a new BIOS release for the X300, but one report from a Linux user thus far suggests that the machine has started hard locking. I can't confirm because this machine is far too important to me (ie I use it for work), so I am holding back on the update until I know what's going on.
<em>Update</em> It occurred to me that it might be useful to document how I changed the region code - install <code>regionset</code> and run it. It will show you your current region code (0xFF for me, ie region 0) and how many changes you have left, then ask if you want to change it.
<em>Second update</em> Lenovo actually withdrew the BIOS update, so clearly something was wrong with it. <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/MIGR-69703.html">This page</a> lists the models for which they have pushed out a fixed version. The X300 is currently still listed as "Coming Soon" :(</p>

    <p>Just a quick update on how things are going.
I've been pretty slow lately because of trying to get as many bugs fixed in Hardy as possible.
However, we've still been working away a bit and the team has continued to grow.</p>
<p>Reliance on gnome is being reduced, and portability is being increased - you can now run Terminator on FreeBSD without a full GNOME install.
Configuration has been entirely replaced - we now offer a stack of config options. If you have gconf available we will look there for gnome terminal settings. If that doesn't work out we'll look for a config file in your home directory and if that fails we have comprehensive default settings.
I'm hoping to push out a release soon because we've also accumulated a few small bugfixes.
The plan from here is to have a major release to land the tabs feature, and then go all out for a massive 1.0 when we can save/restore meta-profiles.
Woo!</p>

    <p>You have new hardware (most likely server).
You pop in a debian/ubuntu installer CD, tell it what kind of keyboard you have and expect it to scan the CDROM for packages, but....uh-oh, it can't find the CD!
What do you do?! Well, realistically there's not a lot you can do to make it work, but you can do a lot to help get it fixed.
You need to pull off /var/log/syslog, the output of lspci, lspci -v and lspci -vvnn.
You may very well find yourself having a problem with that though, because you're still pretty early in a typical linux boot process, so you probably don't have any disks mounted and you may find yourself missing any modules to make that happen.
You should have usb-storage.ko though. That and isofs.ko.
Can you see where this is going? :)
find the .udeb's on your install CD with a working computer, <code>ar -x</code> the core fs modules one and pull out ext3 (and jbd and mbcache), or vfat and its dependencies. put them in a directory, then do <code>mkisofs -o /dev/usbstick1 /path/to/modules</code>.
You now have a partition on your USB stick that is an ISO9660 filesystem (ie a CD). Obviously make sure you don't do this on a USB stick you care about the contents of.
Chuck the USB stick into the broken server, <code>modprobe usb-storage</code>, mount the newly appeared partition and copy the modules over to the right place in /lib/modules/. Unmount the USB stick, modprobe the drivers and now you can put in an ext3/vfat formatted USB stick and you have somewhere to write the debugging information to!
Easy! :) Now file a bug with the debugging information you collected.</p>

    <p>The Thinkpad X300 is a pretty tasty beast. Much nicer screen than the X40, and the SSD is a huge win for lots of IO workloads.
I've still got a fair few Linux support oddities to work through, but thus far people are being very helpful.
When the support is there, this will be a laptop to be highly recommended.</p>
