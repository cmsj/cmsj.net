    <p>It's been far too long, but here it is. Terminator 0.9.
As usual, head over to the <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/" title="Terminator Home Page">home page</a> to get all the links and information you need.
"So what's new in this release?" Well let's have a little look at the ChangeLog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tab support</li>
<li>Drag &amp; Drop support</li>
<li>Added support for ~/.config/terminator/config</li>
<li>Switch the meanings of "horizontal" and "vertical" wrt splitting, after extensive user feedback. Added context menu icons to try and make the meaning clearer.</li>
<li>Added keybindings for terms size and scrollbar manipulation. Thanks Emmanuel Bretelle.</li>
<li>Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible defaults if not, and can be overridden entirely by ~/.config/terminator/config</li>
<li>Support terminal zooming - now you can quickly hide all terminals apart from one and either scale the fontsize or not.</li>
<li>New application icon from Cory Kontros</li>
<li>FreeBSD support (thanks to Thomas Hurst)</li>
<li>and a whole heap of bug fixes. Rock on!</li>
</ul>

    <p>It's taken us some time to get there, but as <a href="https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/0.9" title="Bugs milestoned for 0.9">this page</a> shows, we now have all of the bugs we want solved for 0.9, solved :D
The string freeze came way too late unfortunately, so I'm expecting we'll want to do a 0.9.1 consisting of translations and fixes for any other bugs we figure out on <a href="https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/1.0-beta" title="Bugs milestoned for 1.0">the road to 1.0</a>.
I now need to prepare all of the parts required for a release and push out a final RC build into <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive" title="Terminator PPA">our PPA</a> and if all is well, 0.9 will be released very shortly! Please test it now and tell us if you hit any last minute problems.</p>

    <p>The list of milestone bugs is now clear of items which affect the UI, so we are now in string freeze. I uploaded a new POT for 0.9 so the wonderful, wonderful community of translators can weave their magic. We did have a small false start which required changing one string, but unless anyone shakes out any new bugs, that's it. 0.9 is one step closer to release.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/0.9" title="Terminator 0.9 Milestone bugs">list of bugs</a> left for Terminator 0.9 is getting shorter (although I do keep failing to resist the temptation to add more) and so it's time to try and get some wider testing.
Therefore, we've started uploading beta packages of 0.9 to our PPA. If you want to help test and you run Ubuntu, add this apt source:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">deb</span> <span class="s">http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome-terminator/ubuntu</span> <span class="kp">hardy</span> <span class="kp">main</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you have Terminator installed already from a package, it should then be offered to you as an upgrade, otherwise run:
<code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install terminator</code>
Please report any bugs you find to <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/%20" title="Terminator Bugs @ Launchpad">http://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/</a> and please feel free to drop by #terminator on irc.freenode.net with any feedback!</p>

    <p>The tabs feature is in. drag&amp;dropping terminals is in. For bonus points we've even thrown in a branch that lets you quickly hide all the terminals apart from one (I'm experimentally calling this "terminal zooming").
So that's it for new features for 0.9 and apart from fixing bugs we are now only tweaking the existing features to get them right.
In the next week or so I'll declare a string freeze and get a translation template up so our fantastic translators can get to work while we take care of the final bugs. Right after that, a glorious 0.9 will roll out of the door and into a tarball/PPA/Intrepid near you!</p>

    <p>After learning to use Meld and much chatting with chantra, I'm pleased to announce that we have <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/terminator/trunk/revision/273">landed</a> his <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~chantra/terminator/dnd-tabs">dnd-tabs branch</a> into <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/">Terminator</a> <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/terminator/trunk">trunk</a>.
What does all of that mean? Well, it means that we are a major step closer to being able to release 0.9 (which I have arbitrarily decided should be released only when we have tab support). That's not to say that the release will be today or even in the next week - the branch landing may bring us all the infrastructure we need, but it needs some UI and behaviour love to make sure people don't get lost in a maze of nested tabs (although this seems like such a powerful feature for some users that it may well be available as an option). This is the sort of thing I want to avoid out of the box:
<img alt="Tab madness" src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/terminator-tabs.png">
One other nice thing we get from chantra's branch is drag&amp;drop re-ordering of terminals. You can kind of see it at work in the screenshot below - we highlight the area of the window where the terminal being dragged will end up (note that you can't see the mouse pointer - it should be over the grey square with a drag icon of a terminal):
<img alt="Drag and drop glory" src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/terminator-dnd.png">
Thanks very much to chantra for his hard work on this, and indeed all of the team who have been rocking trunk for weeks now. We'll get this polished and fixed ASAP and into a tarball/PPA and hopefully into things like Fedora and OpenSUSE :)</p>

    <p>It's a month since my last news item and since it's also now almost a month since Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) was released, work has picked up again on Terminator.
We're landing lots of fixes and architectural tweaks all the time, with a few features slipping in there too.</p>
<p>There's no firm deadline for 0.9 yet, but tabs is still the main blocking feature (drag&amp;drop terminal arranging will be included free with that, which is extremely nice).
The team continues to grow, and we're getting more and more blog coverage. Thanks to everyone involved!</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/20/1">Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult</a>.
It's utterly outrageous that we have a law which supposedly prevents individuals from expressing their opinion.
<code>3. A system of intense religious veneration of a particularperson, idea, or object, especially one consideredspurious or irrational by traditional religious bodies;as, the Moonie cult.[PJC]</code>
even if you don't like that, there's:
<code>2. A system of religious belief and worship.[1913 Webster]</code>
so that covers every religion as a cult. As for dangerous - they have a well documented history of legal threats, intimidating behaviour, etc.
<em>Update:</em> It seems that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/23/religion">sanity is not lost</a> and the guy isn't going to be prosecuted because, as should have been fairly obvious, his sign wasn't inciting anything \o/</p>

    <p>... neither of them good.
First off, in a stunning piece of fail, Lenovo have used a drive from one of the few manufacturers that enforces region coding on DVDs in hardware - Matshita, aka Matsushita, aka Panasonic. This is very frustrating and made worse by the drive shipping in a state with no region code set, so no DVDs at all will play. I now either have the choice of changing it no more than 5 times, or risking the drive with some custom firmware which claims to remove the region code.
Secondly, and more worryingly, there is a new BIOS release for the X300, but one report from a Linux user thus far suggests that the machine has started hard locking. I can't confirm because this machine is far too important to me (ie I use it for work), so I am holding back on the update until I know what's going on.
<em>Update</em> It occurred to me that it might be useful to document how I changed the region code - install <code>regionset</code> and run it. It will show you your current region code (0xFF for me, ie region 0) and how many changes you have left, then ask if you want to change it.
<em>Second update</em> Lenovo actually withdrew the BIOS update, so clearly something was wrong with it. <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/MIGR-69703.html">This page</a> lists the models for which they have pushed out a fixed version. The X300 is currently still listed as "Coming Soon" :(</p>
