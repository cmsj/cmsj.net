    <p>After almost 28 years (bar some short spells here and there) I am leaving Brighton, because despite being a fantastic city, the jobs market for IT (especially Linux) really sucks here. The city depends on tourism, there's no space or reason for very much technology. I am therefore abandoning the insurance industry for the advertising industry, and Brighton for London; The job is similar, but with more headroom.
My current mission is finding a sweet house with a bunch of cool, interesting people to dampen the shock of moving, since I don't think I can commit my life and finances to an hour and a half commute a day if I stay here ;)</p>

    <p>Since Firefox doesn't seem to make it very easy to import/export the data it creates (beyond bookmarks at least), I probed my profile and found a signons.txt file which seemed to contain the information, albeit encrypted. No problem I thought, that will be the password I set for the master thingy in firefox. Wrong was I.
A little googling turns up that you should copy the key3.db file too, which is fair enough, but I really think this kind of thing should be easier. That does have a nasty habit of tending to introduce a lot of complexity as more aspects of the program get more flexible, especially from the user's point of view. Interface designers are getting pretty good at making simple interfaces that do the right thing most of the time, with more advanced options hidden away for when they are needed and this is something I like a lot, but it's a shame that all that functionality is isolated with the user.
It makes me pine for the old days of ARexx on the Amiga. It was (fortunately) considered de rigeur for self-respecting applications to support it and it exposed the full user functionality of a program to automatic scripting. If that kind of thing were updated for the modern world and combined with bindings for the various scripting languages, a whole range of possibilities open up. Back in the Amiga days, Arexx was all about automating the hell out of graphical tasks for power users, but I have been thinking about another possible use.
The idea would be an alternative to traditional help systems which are tedious to compile, large to download, not always very helpful, etc. Instead, exploiting an Arexx-like ability to control applications, the "help" system guides users through the application without making them watch a stupid tutorial - it actually helps them.
That is to say, I click "help me export my data", it asks me some simple and sensible questions to figure out what to do, and actually opens the right windows and shows me what to do while it does it. In one feature you are training the user to do it for themselves (maybe they want to do it or they want to use more advanced options), and you are providing a simple, automated solution for the casual/new user who maybe uses this feature once a year at most and doesn't need to learn it. This has to beat writing reams of documentation and capturing thousands of screenshots. You just need a few text prompts to explain what is happening and what the results are, and the rest is scripting that is quite stable. The developers can do whatever they like inside their application, the "help" is controlling it at the level of UI widgets, effectively. It might even be possible to write the scripts and place the text prompts with some kind of tool, rather than write them by hand.
Perhaps it could be done by the UI designers in Glade-like applications - the same functionality could be useful to them for automated testing and they could write the tests, documentation and interface with the same tool into one XML interface file.
Does that make any kind of sense?
Randomly, I also think the next release of Ubuntu should have a little animated Jeff Waugh who pops up and talks to new users, cheers them up and helps them learn how to use Ubuntu Linux, preferably with the above help system ;)</p>

    <p>While I was on holiday recently I went on a bit of a reading marathon, which included The Ancestor's Tale, by Richard Dawkins.
I just can't recommend this book enough - unless you are a wizened old Biology professor you aren't going to know all of the cool and fascinating things in this book, but you should! Especially in these times of madness where Intelligent Design creeps insidiously through the minds of many.
It is literally dripping with footnotes and references to Dawkins's other works and those of other authors (including, obviously, The Origin of Species).
The book starts out in the present day and traces back through time, examining each of the points where major groups of species join into our ancestry. This is an entirely arbitrary way to look at it, but avoiding going forward in time removes any problems with language suggesting that there is intent or purpose in Evolution; And it is more convenient to consider us as the main line because we are humans, but the early chapters make it abundantly clear that the structure is humanocentric because it has a human author and that there can be no suggestion that Evolution was leading towards us.
One of the most fabulous concepts in the book is actually quite generalised and applies to many areas outside Evolution; It relates to how we view things as discrete objects/groups and dislike gradiated scales (e.g. we like to label people black or white when in reality there is a full range of skin tones and a "black" person can have lighter skin than a "white" person). Dawkins refers to this as The Tyrrany of The Discontinuous Mind and I think it's a very interesting way of looking at things.
Sadly this book is not for the faint-hearted, it's a pretty weighty tome and isn't shy about using Biological terminology (almost always with an excellent explanation though). Trust me that it's worth wading through and buy a copy!</p>

    <p>Mr Madonna, sorry, Guy Ritchie, is back with another film. This time it stars Jason Stratham and is generally about unpleasant londoner types; So no change there for Ritchie.
He has an impressive pedigree - Lock Stock is a very very good gangster film and Snatch was a worthy followup, but Revolver is largely nonsense unfortunately.
It has a pretty clever idea and some snappy dialogue, but it also has a lot of meaningless rambling and a very strange central message - other reviewers have suggested this is the influence of Madonna's crazy Kabbalah beliefs, which sounds entirely plausible to me.
So basically don't bother wasting your money, watch Lock Stock or Snatch again :)</p>

Finally, as a bit of fun, I found myself in some TV footage from Glastonbury (click on the images for larger and fullsize versions):

It wasn't all political ranting (which was still very funny), there was a good mix of humour, some of which went beyond the pale for some of the audience; Along with some excellent anecdotes from various anarchic protests he has taken part in.
Two thumbs up :)</p>

    <h1><a href="../2005/07/05/sonyericsson-k750i.html">SonyEricsson k750i</a></h1>

  <div class="article__meta">
    <p class="article__meta__post-date">Tue 05 July 2005</p>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="article__text">
    <p>I just upgraded to a k750i from a t610 and my initial impression after a few days is that it's a very good phone overall. It's not perfect, but it many of the weaknessesof the t610 are gone or minimised, and new features have been added and integrated extremely well.
Visually the phone is quite simple, I have a mostly black one and half of the front is flat clear plastic for the screen, the rest is buttons, which are bigger than those on the t610, but seem like they are quite flimsy and may be easily encouraged to fall off. Time will have to tell on that.
The phone has plenty of hardware, too much really. There's a much more detailed display than on the t610, mp3 playback, fm radio, movie playback, movie recording, flash, autofocus... it's all a bit much really. I already have two digital cameras for different occasions, I don't really need a 2 MegaPixel camera in my phone; I do realise that these are "useful" to a lot of people though ;) The shortcut button between the two soft buttons is very nice, being able to quickly pull up the functions you most use can save a lot of menu diving. The thing has a MemoryStick Duo slot too, which is a genius plan really. If you don't already have a little digital camera to keep in your pocket and a little mp3 player to keep in your other pocket, this phone can realistically do the job of both, and save you having a third pocket used by your phone. The Duo cards are pretty cheap and I have seen suggestion that it can support up to 2GB (mine shipped with a 64MB card pre-installed, in addition to the 30-somethingMB onboard). It also seems to have some kind of 3D graphics ability - my Orange branded unit shipped with a Sega tennis game that is in 3D and Alex's one on O2 came with a 3D flight sim of some kind (I don't mean crazy red and green specs, it is rendering a 3D engine ;)
The biggest improvement over the t610 and probably the best thing about this phone is the software. It's clearly based at least in concept on that of the t610 (which in turn in herits from the t68 and earlier), but it's much, much faster. Speed has often been a problem for SonyEricsson, text message inputs regularly lag a long way behind even a moderate typer. I was often several menus ahead of mine in general use, which is a serious pain. No more, menus appear much quicker and are able to use the higher screen resolution to display more information, reducing the number of questions you have to answer to perform even the simple task of calling someone. The phonebook is wonderful now; if you start typing it jumps to the letters you press instead of waiting a second; instead of selecting a person and then getting a request to select the number, it now displays the default number and offers a direct call option, then offers horizontal scrolling to select alternate numbers/addresses. Very handy. Also nice is the text message recipient chooser keeping a list of recent contacts.
The browser seems to work well, the menus/notices are often animated and pretty, you can have an animated background if you really want. The media player is quite an interesting idea, I am investigating transcoding movies and putting them on memory stick - it'll be interesting to see how the battery stands up to such tests.
The supplied USB cable charges the phone; <strong>very</strong> handy and it also presents the MemoryStick to the host computer as a USB storage device, so it will work with pretty much anything that works with USB memory sticks. It's bloody fantastic to see mobile phone and camera companies adopting this more and more instead of proprietary communication protocols. It makes integration far easier for Operating Systems, as shown by the fact that I connect the phone to my PC running Ubuntu Hoary and it is able to mount the storage drive and notice there is digital camera data there, and offering to import the photos into my albums. Simple things like that make these devices much more rewarding in my opinion (and I'm pretty sure I'm right ;)</p>
