    <p>I think that enough of the planets have aligned in the shape of a failboat that I have been able to successfully upload a source package of Lifesaver to its PPA for Maverick.
I might be wrong though, we'll find out shortly when Launchpad processes the ridiculous output of several ridiculous tools.
Seriously Debian/Ubuntu developers, <em>please</em> sort this out. I really don't care about the intricacies of your workflow - just make it easy for me to be an upstream developer pushing packages into a PPA. Don't make me wade through a sea of hundreds of build tools, dscs, origs, diffs, etc. Just make a bundle and shove it into Launchpad. One command. bzr2ppa in a working directory. Done.
I'm quite sure the failures I had were due either to my incorrect use of some tool or other, or an incorrect setup, but I contend that I shouldn't have to care. Such a tool just needs to know that there's a debian/ that works and a PPA waiting. Make it happen. Go. Now. Are we there yet?
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
(Rant over, the package uploaded and will presumably build shortly, enjoy!)</p>

    <p>This release is mostly to bring a couple of important compatibility fixes with the newest pre-release of VTE, but we also have some updated translations, improved error handling and two new features for you. The features are a URL handler plugin for Maven by Julien Nicolaud and a DBus server that was the result of some work with Andrea Corbellini - for now the only thing this is useful for is opening additional Terminator windows without spawning a new process, but we'll be exploring options in the future to allow more control and interaction with Terminator processes.</p>

    <p>R.I. Pienaar has a Puppet module on github called "concat". Its premise is very simple, it just concatenates fragments of text together into a particular file.
I'm sure that a more seasoned Puppet veteran would have had this running in no time, but since it introduced some new concepts for me, I thought I'd throw up some notes of how I'm using it. I was particularly interested in an example usage I saw which lists the puppet modules a system is using in its /etc/motd, but because of the way Ubuntu handles constructing the motd, I needed to slightly rework the example. In Ubuntu, the /etc/motd file is constructed dynamically when you log in - this is done by pam_motd which executes the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/. One of those scripts (99-footer) will simply append the contents of /etc/motd.tail to /etc/motd after everything else - my example will take advantage of this. If you are already using motd.tail, you could just have this puppet system write to a different file and then drop another script into /etc/update-motd.d/ to append the contents of that different file.
This is what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>git clone http://github.com/ripienaar/puppet-concat.git</li>
<li>Move the resulting git branch to /etc/puppet/modules/concat and add it to my top-level site manifest that includes modules</li>
<li>Create a class to manage /etc/motd.tail. In my setup this ends up being /etc/puppet/manifests/classes/motd.pp, which is included by my default node, but your setup is probably different. This is what my class looks like:</li>
</ul>

       <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So that's quite a mouthful. Let's break it down:
 * We have to include concat::setup so the concat module can...set... up :)
 * We then set a variable pointing at the location of the file we want to manage
 * We then instantiate the concat module for the file we want to manage and set properties like the ownership/mode
 * We then call the concat::fragment function for two specific fragments we want in the output - a header and a footer (although I do this on a single line, so it's the phrase "Puppet modules" and "\n\n" respectively). They're forced to be header/footer by the "order" parameter - by making sure we use a low number for the header and a high number for the footer, we get the layout we expect.
 * Outsite this class we define a function motd::register which other modules will call and the content they supply will be handed to concat::fragment with a default order parameter of 20 (which is higher than the value we used for the header and lower than the footer one).</p>
<p>Finally, in each of my modules I include the line:
    <code>motd::register{"someawesomemodule":}</code></p>
<p>and now when I ssh to a node, I see a line like:
    Puppet modules: web ssh</p>
<p>It's a fairly simple little thing, but quite pleasing and from here out it's almost zero effort - just adding the motd::register calls to each module.</p>

    <p>I am trying to do as much management on my new VM servers as possible with Puppet, but these are machines I still frequently log on to, and not everything is managed by Puppet, so it's entirely possible that in a fit of forgetfulness I will start editing a file that Puppet is managing and then be annoyed when my changes are lost next time Puppet runs.
Since prior preparation and planning prevents pitifully poor performance, I decided to do something about this.
Thus, I present a VIM plugin called TangledStrings, which I'm distributing as a Vimball (.vba) you can download from its <a href="http://launchpad.net/tangledstrings" title="TangledStrings">project page</a> on Launchpad. For more information on Vimball formatted plugins, see <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pi_vimball.html" title="Vimball Documentation">this page</a>. To install the plugin, simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>vim tangledstrings.vba</li>
<li>Follow the instructions from Vimball to type: :so %</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, TangledStrings will show a (configurable) warning message when you load a Puppet-owned file:
<a href="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/puppetstrings_alert.png"><img src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/puppetstrings_alert.png" title="tangledstrings_alert" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11573" width="403" height="127" /></a>
This message can be disabled, and you can choose to enable a persistent message in the VIM status line instead:
<a href="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tangledstrings_statusline.png"><img src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tangledstrings_statusline.png" title="tangledstrings_statusline" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11574" width="403" height="127" /></a>
(or you could choose to enable both of these methods).
For more information, see the documentation included in the Vimball which you can display with the VIM command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">:help TangledStrings</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Suggestions, improvements, patches, etc. are most welcome! Email me or use Launchpad to file bugs and propose merges.</p>

    <p>Last night I had a lovely meal out and then saw Inception with Rike and some friends.
I've really enjoyed all of Christopher Nolan's previous films and I think he does an excellent job of creating surprising and compelling stories.
I'm not really going to say anything about the plot, other than to advise you avoid reading anything about it until you've seen it - not because there's anything particularly secret, but because it's nice to not have any preconceptions about what might happen.
For me, the best films have me leaving the cinema totally caught up in their world, my mind reeling with the possibilities of what they have explored. Inception achieved this, and I want to see it again, although preferably at home on Bluray so I can hear every word of dialogue properly - a surprising shortcoming of one of London's flagship cinemas.</p>

    <p>I was talking to a colleague earlier about Puppet and its ability to install packages. I'd not really given it much thought beyond using it to install packages on classes of machines, but he mentioned one particular package which gets updated quite frequently, but is extremely low risk to update - tzdata. By setting this to "ensure =&gt; latest" rather than "ensure =&gt; present" I can forget about ever having to upgrade that package again \o/
Simple really, but it hadn't occurred to me.</p>
