Last night I went to [Dig in the ribs](http://www.digintheribs.co.uk) with a few friends and some 2-for-1 coupons. It's a Tex-Mex restaurant in Brighton's food quarter (a nice way of saying "that road with all the steak and chinese places" ;) that offers a fine array of meats and sauces.
I had a 16oz T-bone and brought a really feeble appetite with me, so I didn't make a very impressive dent in it, but Simon, Simon and Tam put in a good showing and tucked into a big plate of Nachos and sticky desserts too!
Well worth a visit, although the staff could have been a little more attentive, we waited about half an hour to pay the bill; It aids digestion though ;)
