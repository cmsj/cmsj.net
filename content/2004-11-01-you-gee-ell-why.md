It's Monday. It's the 1st of November. It's 2004. This means only one thing...
Tonight I am going to an [Ugly Duckling](http://www.uglyduckling.us/) gig in London! WOO! More when I've actually been ;)
**Update:** Wooo! UD rock live! They were unfortunately a little late arriving, so could only play for about an hour, but the set they did was fantastic - funky and funny. I strongly recommend you [grab their albums/EPs](http://www.uglyduckling.us/sounds/).
