Suck suck suck suck suck. That's how much a really sucky thing sucks. What sucks more than that is crap like [this](http://www.grain.org/articles/?id=6).
For those who don't read the link, the 4 word summary is "Operation Screw The Iraqis", this time by rewriting their constitution to place all sorts of insane legal restrictions on their agricultural industry and specifically the *seeds* they are allowed to use. I mean, come on, we've been doing this agriculture thing for thousands of years without needing large corporations to sell us infertile seeds we have to buy year after year.
In my opinion it is *sick* and amoral to do this kind of thing. I sincerely hope the new Iraqi government overturns *insane* orders like this, but I don't hold out a lot of hope given the amounts of money people stand to make :-/
As the article makes out, this is all about pleasing the WTO, which is a whole other rant I won't get into now, suffice to say, despite whatever good intentions they have, they suck too.
