I've disabled comments because they are filling up with spam. Sucks, but then this is the Internet, where people will take advantage of anything they can, just because they can. I'm not sure why anyone thinks that people reading about poker and fuck knows what else in my comments will make them part with their $$$, but the mentality of spammers is far far removed from that of normal people.
