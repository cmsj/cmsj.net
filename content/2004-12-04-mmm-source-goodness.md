I really didn't think it would go this smoothly at all, but I have just been playing Half Life 2 and Counterstrike:Source at pretty acceptable rates in [Transgaming](http://www.transgaming.com/)'s Cedega. Woo!
It's a really impressive engine - realistic physics is definitely going to make games a load more fun :)
