Last night I went to see Groove Armada at the Brixton Academy for marky's birthday. It was a truly excellent show - the performance was really spot on and they have done an excellent job preparing the tour so it's not just a string of set pieces; It was more like an arrangement of their work with the various tracks rolling through each other beautifully. The visuals were funky and the atmosphere was very friendly.
If you have the option of seeing them live, take it. I will be hunting the festival listings next year for their appearances ;)
(and thanks to Simon's parents for letting us stay the night, plus for having awesome cats :)
