Blimey. This is quite some intense action!
In a way it's more like playing Quake than it is Half Life - it feels even more intense than the original Half Life multiplayer deathmatch at least.
It's no Counterstrike:Source though, I am liking that game even more now, especially what with it running at &gt;50fps (my CPU doing SSE2 seems to make something of a large difference over similarly clocked 32bit Athlons)
