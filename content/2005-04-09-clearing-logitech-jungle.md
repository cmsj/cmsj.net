I have uploaded a mini HOWTO into my [techie documents](http://docs.tenshu.net/) section that covers configuring a Linux machine running Xorg to make best possible use of a Logitech keyboard and mouse (the Elite and MX700 respectively) and the bundles they are sold together in (the Duo MX and Cordless Desktop MX).
It requires a fairly recent distro because it uses some features/data only available in Xorg so far. Personally I am using these settings without problems on my Ubuntu Hoary machine.
A direct link to the HOWTO is [here](http://docs.tenshu.net/Logitech-MX-Duo-mini-HOWTO/).
