Last weekend I went up to Edale in Derbyshire with Simon, Tam, Marky and Tom. We had a most excellent time (albeit a bit muddy and smelly). My photos are [here](http://gallery.tenshu.net/thumbnails.php?album=26), Tam's are [here](http://tamsin.moye.me.uk/pics/gallery/peaks/) and marky's are [here](http://photos.mark.section.me.uk/edalex/).
