I forgot to mention that I saw The Chemical Brothers live recently. They're touring at the moment, so a few of us caught them at the Brighton Centre (not the best gig venue in the world ever, it has to be said). They rock a bunch :)
Up and coming musical happenings are my trips to Glastonbury and Big Chill festivals - expect lots of photos unless some pikey half-inches my camera ;)
