[![Mark Thomas on stage at Concorde 2](http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_dsc00038.jpg)](http://gallery.tenshu.net/displayimage.php?album=4&pos=2)I saw Mark Thomas doing a stand-up gig at Concorde 2 in Brighton this evening with Alex, Simon, and Simon and jolly good it was too. The man can certainly express some righteous anger!
It wasn't all political ranting (which was still very funny), there was a good mix of humour, some of which went beyond the pale for some of the audience; Along with some excellent anecdotes from various anarchic protests he has taken part in.
Two thumbs up :)
