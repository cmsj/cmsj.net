I've been up to things again and finally got around to putting the pictures up.
![Jazz Cafe Picnic](http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/2005_08_14-Jazz_Cafe_Picnic/thumb_dsc00120.jpg)To kick things off we have a gallery of photos from the Jazz Cafe Picnic at Marble Hill in Twickenham (London). It can be found [here](http://gallery.tenshu.net/thumbnails.php?album=32).
![Science Museum](http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/2005_08_24-Science_museum/thumb_img_0137.jpg)On Tuesday I went to London to meet up with adie and we wandered around the Science Museum, saw a 3D IMAX movie and looked round an exhibition of costumes/props from the Hitchhiker's Guide movie. The gallery is [here](http://gallery.tenshu.net/thumbnails.php?album=31).
Finally, as a bit of fun, I found myself in some TV footage from Glastonbury (click on the images for larger and fullsize versions):
[![Me at Glastonbury](http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_glasto2005-royksopp.jpg)](http://gallery.tenshu.net/displayimage.php?album=4&pos=4) [![Me at Glastonbury (captioned)](http://gallery.tenshu.net/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_glasto2005-royksopp-named.jpg)](http://gallery.tenshu.net/displayimage.php?album=4&pos=3)
On the left is the original TV image with us circled, on the right is the same shot, but with us magnified (or rather, the back of our heads magnified)
