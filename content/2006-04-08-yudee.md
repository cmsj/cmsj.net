A couple of years older, a couple of years wiser, I saw [Ugly Duckling](http://www.uglyduckling.us/) again at the Jazz Cafe in cheery old Camden Town recently. Last time they were [Meat Shakin'](http://www.last.fm/music/Ugly+Duckling/Taste+the+Secret), but this time they had [Bang for The Buck](http://www.last.fm/music/Ugly+Duckling/Bang+for+the+Buck) which is a really sweet album and makes for some very cool live performance.
The venue is kinda small so it's \*very\* cosy, but the only people at UD gigs seem to be all other UD fans, so everyone is having a shitload of fun and is ignoring the inevitable game of "guess the body part" ;)
From a weird, observational point of view, the typical demographic this time was older and more suburban than last time, which is...as I said, weird.
If you're not familiar with UD, head to their site (link above) and it will play a track. Reload for another. Realise you want the rest ;)
