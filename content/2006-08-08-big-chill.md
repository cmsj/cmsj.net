Over the weekend I was at Eastnor Castle with a bunch of friends for The Big Chill, a fantastic little music festival that happens every August. It's nice and small (I reckon about 30,000 people) and very friendly, with lots of very cool bands playing (mostly ones I haven't heard of, which is nice).
I expect some pictures will appear sooner or later, but in the mean time, sucks to be all of you that didn't go! ;)
