    < koudelkat> He's such a boar
    < Ng> koudelkat: bee quiet, that's a terribull pun ;)
     Ng: No need to be piggish
    < Ng> pathetick ;)
    < koudelkat> I can't bear this any more :'(
     Now you've got koudelka cowed
    < cdavies> lemur alone, he's had enough.
     * koudelkat eyes lily's sheeply curves
     koudelkat: stop being so catty
    < koudelkat> I'm no pussy!
     true, you're definitely not henpecked
    < koudelkat> Don't egg me on.
    < koudelkat> Ok, we've milked this quite enough
     Chicken
    < koudelkat> :'(
    < cdavies> koudelkat: I don't think you've been gibbon enough credit.
    < koudelkat> then I shall crow in delight over the recognition
    < koudelkat> I don't mean to worm my way in though
    < cdavies> civet you've done now? You can your puns.
     ok, time to stop monkeying around
    < koudelkat> yeah, it's not cricket
    < cdavies> let me stick my proboscis in to this conversation.
     cdavies: OK, but just what is it giraffe-ter?
    < koudelkat> lilyj: nothing at all, he's lion
    < cdavies> lilyj: I can see you're a shrew-d operator.
     cdavies: No need to fawn
    < cdavies> lilyj: yes, deer.
    < koudelkat> you guys are doeps
     don't be a dik dik
     which is my favortie animal name, btw
    < cdavies> marmoset I shouldn't talk to strangers.
     cdavies: I was expecting "marmoset there'd be days like these."
    < koudelkat> she toad me the same thing!
     cdavies: it would have rammed the pun home
    < cdavies> If I can't think up a good pun soon, I may have to fall back on a meer cat joke.
     but ewe missed it
    < koudelkat> what an ass!
    < koudelkat> he should have mule'd it over more.
     cdavies: If you had responded to "he's lion" with "he's not lion, he's a meerkat" you could have even gotten a rimshot
    < cdavies> I didn't want to hog the glory.
    < koudelkat> I'm sure one of us would have swined about it
    < koudelkat> But we've no need to ham i tup
     probably not.  we're too busy putting on hares
    < koudelkat> and steaking our own claims
     steering each other in wrong directions
    < cdavies> owl come right out and say it, this coversation makes me want to shriek and run out to the barn.
     a rather mousey response
    < koudelkat> we do hawk bad puns :(
     It's getting harder to ferret them out, though
    < cdavies> maybe it's time to clam up then.
     cdavies: I think you're just being shellfish
     lilyj: it's good to see that you still have elephantitis
    < koudelkat> lilyj: you'd better krill him!
    < cdavies> don't mount him though, he's been known to humpback.
    < koudelkat> cdavies: not if she starts whaling on you
    < cdavies> yeah, squid pro quo for putting up with your puns.
    < koudelkat> cdavies: you're a sucker for them
     he wolfs them down
     damn, this conversation is just beastly
    < koudelkat> it has a tendency to dragon though...
     maybe we could sire a new one
     if everyone is done horsing around, that is...
    < koudelkat> you're such a cheetah
     you're going to have have to pony up an explanation for that accusation
    < koudelkat> that wasnt stipulated in the rider agreement
     don't try to jockey around the subject
     Your telling of tails gives me paws
    < koudelkat> lilyj: mare-ry me?
     koudelkat: am I the gorilla your dreams?
    < koudelkat> lilyj: i'm homoerectus for your man though :'(
     salamander of taste, I suppose
    < koudelkat> I'm actually newt-ral on the subject..
     I gnu you would be
    < Ng> after all this punnery there's going to have to be some lion down
    < koudelkat> yeah, they've got no sole now
    < Ng> oh my cod this is getting bat ;)
     I can't be herring this correctly
    < koudelkat> We should really put lox on our mouths
    < Ng> lilyj: there there deer, it'll be ok
     now Ng is fawning over me
     salmon should stop us
    < Ng> noo! wevil got to keep going! ;)
    < Ng> frogging and country
     Ng: I thought bad puns were your bugbear
    < koudelkat> Ng: Flea while you still can!
     Fly away
     before the bull gets any thicker
    < Ng> eel brb ;)
    < cdavies> and with that, he's herring off in to the night.
    < koudelkat> i'm just gonna tuna you guys out
    < koudelkat> I dont want us to get into a roe about this.
     Ng: We'll whlek-ome you back with open arms
     whelk-ome
    < koudelkat> lilyj: he's such an urchin
     cdavies: Yeah, he left us to flounder about on our own
    < cdavies> always musseling in on our punnage.
    < koudelkat> he crabs all the good ones :'(
    < cdavies> he's sole'd out.
     what a rat
    < koudelkat> to another orca-stra.
    < cdavies> what a cheap skate.
    < koudelkat> let's make him walk the plankton
     he'd just fish himself out
     but i suppose we could just gopher it and see what happens
    < koudelkat> that's what he went to school for
    < cdavies> I swear, he's one of the pod people.
    < koudelkat> can't trust men of that elk
    < cdavies> you moose love punnani bad.
    < koudelkat> well, i do love critter-us
    < cdavies> Oh well, I can't just yak on. Must work.
     that pun will hound me for days
    < koudelkat> i'm gonna be feline it for days
     I might even bitch about it
    < koudelkat> I've haddock with you guys, I'm gonna work.
     koudelkat: OK, simian the morning and we'll continue
    < koudelkat> lilyj: I hope we can include frogging in the agenda, I've been bad.
    < cdavies> we wouldn't have to frog you, if only you'd toad the line.
    < koudelkat> lilyj: Meat you in the morning, then.
    < Ng> cdavies: he always weasels his way out of such things
    < cdavies> Ng: Oh, I didn't know, I'm newt to this.
     cdavies: that' stoat-ally untrue
    < koudelkat> we just spent an hour on delicious puns
    < koudelkat> i didn't even notice
     it was our dogged determination that got us through
    < cdavies> that and years of squirrelling away puns.
     But we were finally able to come out of our shells
     fur what it's worth
    < cdavies> and that the audience didn't let fruit fly.
    < Ng> I'm impressed, I thought it'd die out quickly, but you all kept beavering away
     cdavies: They're just gnat like that
     of course, sometimes they can bee waspish
    < koudelkat> I canter do this anymore. :(
     koudelkat: no need to get your gallop
    < Ng> koudelkat: come bacteria tomorrow
    < Ng> and your salvation shall be found virus
    < cdavies> you shouldn't ape jesus.
     +r
    < Ng> cdavies: he won't be back until the raptor ;)
     woah, this has been going on for ages
    < Ng> kif: I'll bison time while you catch up ;)
    < Ng> then you can yak with us! ;)

     * kif just bees quiet
    < cdavies> kif: I you don't think of puns, you ruminant for the rest of us.
    < cdavies> and that gets my goat.
     besides, it probably won't beetle tomorrow sometime that we decide to stop
    < koudelkat> i'm horny
     lilyj: but you've ewe-sed mouse-t of the possibilities already!
     kif: Don't be a tit :D
    < Ng> kif: so start robin other peoples' ;)
