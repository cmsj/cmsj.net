For those who don't know me on IRC, I go by `Ng` there, and I claim that the following log is the greatest IRC conversation that has ever taken place.

```irc
    <koudelkat> He's such a boar
    <Ng> koudelkat: bee quiet, that's a terribull pun ;)
    <lilyj> Ng: No need to be piggish
    <Ng> pathetick ;)
    <koudelkat> I can't bear this any more :'(
    <lilyj> Now you've got koudelka cowed
    <cdavies> lemur alone, he's had enough.
     * koudelkat eyes lily's sheeply curves
    <lilyj> koudelkat: stop being so catty
    <koudelkat> I'm no pussy!
    <lilyj> true, you're definitely not henpecked
    <koudelkat> Don't egg me on.
    <koudelkat> Ok, we've milked this quite enough
    <lilyj> Chicken
    <koudelkat> :'(
    <cdavies> koudelkat: I don't think you've been gibbon enough credit.
    <koudelkat> then I shall crow in delight over the recognition
    <koudelkat> I don't mean to worm my way in though
    <cdavies> civet you've done now? You can your puns.
    <lilyj> ok, time to stop monkeying around
    <koudelkat> yeah, it's not cricket
    <cdavies> let me stick my proboscis in to this conversation.
    <lilyj> cdavies: OK, but just what is it giraffe-ter?
    <koudelkat> lilyj: nothing at all, he's lion
    <cdavies> lilyj: I can see you're a shrew-d operator.
    <lilyj> cdavies: No need to fawn
    <cdavies> lilyj: yes, deer.
    <koudelkat> you guys are doeps
    <lilyj> don't be a dik dik
    <cdavies> marmoset I shouldn't talk to strangers.
    <lilyj> cdavies: I was expecting "marmoset there'd be days like these."
    <koudelkat> she toad me the same thing!
    <lilyj> cdavies: it would have rammed the pun home
    <cdavies> If I can't think up a good pun soon, I may have to fall back on a meer cat joke.
    <lilyj> but ewe missed it
    <koudelkat> what an ass!
    <koudelkat> he should have mule'd it over more.
    <lilyj> cdavies: If you had responded to "he's lion" with "he's not lion, he's a meerkat" you could have even gotten a rimshot
    <cdavies> I didn't want to hog the glory.
    <koudelkat> I'm sure one of us would have swined about it
    <koudelkat> But we've no need to ham i tup
    <lilyj> probably not.  we're too busy putting on hares
    <koudelkat> and steaking our own claims
    <lilyj> steering each other in wrong directions
    <cdavies> owl come right out and say it, this coversation makes me want to shriek and run out to the barn.
    <lilyj> a rather mousey response
    <koudelkat> we do hawk bad puns :(
    <lilyj> It's getting harder to ferret them out, though
    <cdavies> maybe it's time to clam up then.
    <lilyj> cdavies: I think you're just being shellfish
    <koudelkat> lilyj: you'd better krill him!
    <cdavies> don't mount him though, he's been known to humpback.
    <koudelkat> cdavies: not if she starts whaling on you
    <cdavies> yeah, squid pro quo for putting up with your puns.
    <koudelkat> cdavies: you're a sucker for them
    <lilyj> he wolfs them down
    <lilyj> damn, this conversation is just beastly
    <koudelkat> it has a tendency to dragon though...
    <lilyj> maybe we could sire a new one
    <lilyj> if everyone is done horsing around, that is...
    <koudelkat> you're such a cheetah
    <lilyj> you're going to have have to pony up an explanation for that accusation
    <koudelkat> that wasnt stipulated in the rider agreement
    <lilyj> don't try to jockey around the subject
    <lilyj> Your telling of tails gives me paws
    <koudelkat> lilyj: mare-ry me?
    <lilyj> koudelkat: am I the gorilla your dreams?
    <koudelkat> lilyj: i'm homoerectus for your man though :'(
    <lilyj> salamander of taste, I suppose
    <koudelkat> I'm actually newt-ral on the subject..
    <lilyj> I gnu you would be
    <Ng> after all this punnery there's going to have to be some lion down
    <koudelkat> yeah, they've got no sole now
    <Ng> oh my cod this is getting bat ;)
    <lilyj> I can't be herring this correctly
    <koudelkat> We should really put lox on our mouths
    <Ng> lilyj: there there deer, it'll be ok
    <lilyj> now Ng is fawning over me
    <lilyj> salmon should stop us
    <Ng> noo! wevil got to keep going! ;)
    <Ng> frogging and country
    <lilyj> Ng: I thought bad puns were your bugbear
    <koudelkat> Ng: Flea while you still can!
    <lilyj> Fly away
    <lilyj> before the bull gets any thicker
    <Ng> eel brb ;)
    <cdavies> and with that, he's herring off in to the night.
    <koudelkat> i'm just gonna tuna you guys out
    <koudelkat> I dont want us to get into a roe about this.
    <lilyj> Ng: We'll whelk-ome you back with open arms
    <koudelkat> lilyj: he's such an urchin
    <lilyj> cdavies: Yeah, he left us to flounder about on our own
    <cdavies> always musseling in on our punnage.
    <koudelkat> he crabs all the good ones :'(
    <cdavies> he's sole'd out.
    <lilyj> what a rat
    <koudelkat> to another orca-stra.
    <cdavies> what a cheap skate.
    <koudelkat> let's make him walk the plankton
    <lilyj> he'd just fish himself out
    <lilyj> but i suppose we could just gopher it and see what happens
    <koudelkat> that's what he went to school for
    <cdavies> I swear, he's one of the pod people.
    <koudelkat> can't trust men of that elk
    <cdavies> you moose love punnani bad.
    <koudelkat> well, i do love critter-us
    <cdavies> Oh well, I can't just yak on. Must work.
    <lilyj> that pun will hound me for days
    <koudelkat> i'm gonna be feline it for days
    <lilyj> I might even bitch about it
    <koudelkat> I've haddock with you guys, I'm gonna work.
    <lilyj> koudelkat: OK, simian the morning and we'll continue
    <koudelkat> lilyj: I hope we can include frogging in the agenda, I've been bad.
    <cdavies> we wouldn't have to frog you, if only you'd toad the line.
    <koudelkat> lilyj: Meat you in the morning, then.
    <Ng> cdavies: he always weasels his way out of such things
    <cdavies> Ng: Oh, I didn't know, I'm newt to this.
    <lilyj> cdavies: that' stoat-ally untrue
    <koudelkat> we just spent an hour on delicious puns
    <koudelkat> i didn't even notice
    <lilyj> it was our dogged determination that got us through
    <cdavies> that and years of squirrelling away puns.
    <lilyj> But we were finally able to come out of our shells
    <lilyj> fur what it's worth
    <cdavies> and that the audience didn't let fruit fly.
    <Ng> I'm impressed, I thought it'd die out quickly, but you all kept beavering away
    <lilyj> cdavies: They're just gnat like that
    <lilyj> of course, sometimes they can bee waspish
    <koudelkat> I canter do this anymore. :(
    <lilyj> koudelkat: no need to get your gallop
    <Ng> koudelkat: come bacteria tomorrow
    <Ng> and your salvation shall be found virus
    <cdavies> you shouldn't ape jesus.
    <Ng> cdavies: he won't be back until the raptor ;)
    <kif> woah, this has been going on for ages

    <cdavies> kif: If you don't think of puns, you ruminant for the rest of us.
