One of the games I picked up with the PS3 was Motorstorm, which is a dirt racing game with nitrous boosting. You've probably played games like it. It's good fun though, and very easy on the eye. Online play is great, even if it does make me look bad almost every race!
I asked for this one from the second hand shelf (which most games shops seem to offer) - it's very good fun, but I'm not sure it's worth paying full whack for.
