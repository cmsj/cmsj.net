This is a PSP game which has been ported to the PS3 and had its graphics restored to the original arcade levels.
It's a Tekken game, what do you want, poetry? You fight people in the traditional rounds system. When you beat one, you fight another and it gets a bit harder. That's it.
There are a couple of slightly different fight modes, but nowhere near what it should be to be considered a full and complete game.
It's a small download for about 6 quid and it's fast, Tekken fun. I can't argue with that. That is until Soul Caliber comes out in a few months. That most certainly ought to be worth a full game.
