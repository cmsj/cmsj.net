title: Terminator 0.1 released
slug: terminator-01-released
date: 2007-07-28


I've just pushed out the first release ever of Terminator, a python script to make a window have multiple Terminals in it.
It's still very rough around the edges. And the middle. But it's there!
Rather than repeat myself here, just click over to the [Terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/) page for full details.
