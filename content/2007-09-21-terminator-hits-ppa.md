If you've been over to my [Terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/) page you may have noticed that I use Launchpad for basically all of the services of releasing.
Taking this one step further, I have been building packages for Ubuntu Gutsy with Launchpad's excellent PPA service. Details for how to get your Terminator goodness from PPA have been added to the [Terminator Homepage](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/).
