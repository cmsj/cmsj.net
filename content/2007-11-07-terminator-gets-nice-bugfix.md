Thanks to the hero [Kees Cook](http://outflux.net) Terminator is now able to resize its window smaller. A pretty stupid bug to have, but a fairly peculiar fix.
Either way, it's done now. It's starting to feel like I just need to polish up some features, fix a few tiny bugs and Terminator will be widely usable (not that it will be used widely because of how crazy it is).
Profile support is still a way off though, unfortunately.
