title: Terminator 0.5 released
slug: terminator-05-released
date: 2007-11-09


Terminator 0.5 is out. This is another bugfix release. This one includes some pretty major fixes and some new default behaviours.
Maximisation of the window is no longer the default (but you can pass -m to do it). Additionally, you will just get one terminal when you start Terminator. Ctrl-shift-h and ctrl-shift-v will split the terminals (or you can still right click for a context menu).
Ctrl-shift-q will close a terminal, and ctrl-shift-n/ctrl-shift-p will cycle through the next/previous terminals respectively.
As usual, please head over [here](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/) for the goodness. Gutsy packages will be hitting my PPA shortly.
