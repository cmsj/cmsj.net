I recently got a Nokia n95 from Orange and have been playing with it for a week or two.
Overall I am most happy with the thing. It's a little bit slow and stranger than SonyEricsson's firmware in some ways, but it has some wicked features:
\* GPS
\* TV Out
\* Symbian
GPS is obviously useful, you can bring up a map of where you are and look around. The TV Out was a total surprise though, and is incredibly cool. I figured it would just be used for things like image galleries, and while they are specifically tailored for TV output, it works everywhere! You can nagivate all the menus, run apps and so on.
Symbian is just really handy because there are plenty of apps for it and a pretty open development environment.
Short review, but all in all, I'm happy so far :)
