The awesomeness of this phone continues... as well as a rash of cool apps I've installed, I also just tried out the "Home Network" features. What this actually refers to is uPnP, specifically DLNA.
What does all that mean? It means I can view/copy the photos/movies/music from the phone with my PS3, which also means I can not only use the TV out to display arbitrary things, I can also view the media digitally, via wifi through a easily available/usable interface.
This feels like the future!
