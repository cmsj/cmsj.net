Some administrivia about my PPA builds of Terminator.
Firstly, and somewhat late (for which I apologise), the 0.7 release should be available shortly from the PPA. It's just been accepted, so should be built for gutsy soon.
Secondly, as some people may have noticed, Terminator is now included in the Universe repository of hardy (for which I humbly thank all involved in making it happen).
When hardy is released, I will remove terminator from my PPA. at that point, we can consider publishing further gutsy packages in the Terminator team's PPA, however, I'm not hugely keen on supporting old distro releases that I don't run myself anymore.
