Maybe you're fresh out of college or university, or maybe you just love tinkering with computers so much you didn't bother with stuffy education.
We're [looking for someone](http://www.ubuntu.com/employment#jdce) to take on a junior role in our sysadmin team, so if you're interested, take a look at the description and mail our lovely HR people!
