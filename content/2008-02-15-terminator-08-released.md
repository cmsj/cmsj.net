title: Terminator 0.8 released
slug: terminator-08-released.md
date: 2008-02-15


This is a bugfix and feature and infrastructure release.
It should be a lot better than 0.7 in less focussed ways - e.g. icons, menu integration, better gconf support.
As usual hit up the [Terminator home page](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/) for more.
