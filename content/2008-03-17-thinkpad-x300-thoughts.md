The Thinkpad X300 is a pretty tasty beast. Much nicer screen than the X40, and the SSD is a huge win for lots of IO workloads.
I've still got a fair few Linux support oddities to work through, but thus far people are being very helpful.
When the support is there, this will be a laptop to be highly recommended.
