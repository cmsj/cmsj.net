[Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/20/1).
It's utterly outrageous that we have a law which supposedly prevents individuals from expressing their opinion.
`3. A system of intense religious veneration of a particularperson, idea, or object, especially one consideredspurious or irrational by traditional religious bodies;as, the Moonie cult.[PJC]`
even if you don't like that, there's:
`2. A system of religious belief and worship.[1913 Webster]`
so that covers every religion as a cult. As for dangerous - they have a well documented history of legal threats, intimidating behaviour, etc.
*Update:* It seems that [sanity is not lost](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/23/religion) and the guy isn't going to be prosecuted because, as should have been fairly obvious, his sign wasn't inciting anything \\o/
