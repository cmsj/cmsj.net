It's a month since my last news item and since it's also now almost a month since Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) was released, work has picked up again on Terminator.
We're landing lots of fixes and architectural tweaks all the time, with a few features slipping in there too.

There's no firm deadline for 0.9 yet, but tabs is still the main blocking feature (drag&drop terminal arranging will be included free with that, which is extremely nice).
The team continues to grow, and we're getting more and more blog coverage. Thanks to everyone involved!
