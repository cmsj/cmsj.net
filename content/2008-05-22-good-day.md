After learning to use Meld and much chatting with chantra, I'm pleased to announce that we have [landed](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/terminator/trunk/revision/273) his [dnd-tabs branch](https://code.launchpad.net/~chantra/terminator/dnd-tabs) into [Terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/) [trunk](https://code.launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/terminator/trunk).
What does all of that mean? Well, it means that we are a major step closer to being able to release 0.9 (which I have arbitrarily decided should be released only when we have tab support). That's not to say that the release will be today or even in the next week - the branch landing may bring us all the infrastructure we need, but it needs some UI and behaviour love to make sure people don't get lost in a maze of nested tabs (although this seems like such a powerful feature for some users that it may well be available as an option). This is the sort of thing I want to avoid out of the box:

One other nice thing we get from chantra's branch is drag&drop re-ordering of terminals. You can kind of see it at work in the screenshot below - we highlight the area of the window where the terminal being dragged will end up (note that you can't see the mouse pointer - it should be over the grey square with a drag icon of a terminal):

Thanks very much to chantra for his hard work on this, and indeed all of the team who have been rocking trunk for weeks now. We'll get this polished and fixed ASAP and into a tarball/PPA and hopefully into things like Fedora and OpenSUSE :)
