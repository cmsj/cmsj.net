title: 0.9 loose feature freeze
slug: 09-loose-feature-freeze
date: 2008-05-30


The tabs feature is in. drag&dropping terminals is in. For bonus points we've even thrown in a branch that lets you quickly hide all the terminals apart from one (I'm experimentally calling this "terminal zooming").
So that's it for new features for 0.9 and apart from fixing bugs we are now only tweaking the existing features to get them right.
In the next week or so I'll declare a string freeze and get a translation template up so our fantastic translators can get to work while we take care of the final bugs. Right after that, a glorious 0.9 will roll out of the door and into a tarball/PPA/Intrepid near you!
