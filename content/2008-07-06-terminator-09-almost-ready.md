It's taken us some time to get there, but as [this page](https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/0.9 "Bugs milestoned for 0.9") shows, we now have all of the bugs we want solved for 0.9, solved :D
The string freeze came way too late unfortunately, so I'm expecting we'll want to do a 0.9.1 consisting of translations and fixes for any other bugs we figure out on [the road to 1.0](https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/1.0-beta "Bugs milestoned for 1.0").
I now need to prepare all of the parts required for a release and push out a final RC build into [our PPA](https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive "Terminator PPA") and if all is well, 0.9 will be released very shortly! Please test it now and tell us if you hit any last minute problems.
