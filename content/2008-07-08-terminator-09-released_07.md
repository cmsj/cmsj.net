It's been far too long, but here it is. Terminator 0.9.
As usual, head over to the [home page](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/ "Terminator Home Page") to get all the links and information you need.
"So what's new in this release?" Well let's have a little look at the ChangeLog:

  * Tab support
  * Drag & Drop support
  * Added support for ~/.config/terminator/config
  * Switch the meanings of "horizontal" and "vertical" wrt splitting, after extensive user feedback. Added context menu icons to try and make the meaning clearer.
  * Added keybindings for terms size and scrollbar manipulation. Thanks Emmanuel Bretelle.
  * Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible defaults if not, and can be overridden entirely by ~/.config/terminator/config
  * Support terminal zooming - now you can quickly hide all terminals apart from one and either scale the fontsize or not.
  * New application icon from Cory Kontros
  * FreeBSD support (thanks to Thomas Hurst)
  * and a whole heap of bug fixes. Rock on!
