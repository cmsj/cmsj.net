title: Terminator 0.10 released
slug: terminator-010-released_28
date: 2008-08-29


It's been a week or so shy of two months since we pushed 0.9 out of the door and originally we planned on following up with a 0.9.1 release shortly after to clear up some bugs, but for a variety of not particularly good reasons this never happened.
Instead we've got a new release for you... 0.10.
It doesn't have any shiny whizz-bang features like 0.9 had, but it does bring a bunch of bug fixes and the groundwork necessary for our 1.0 release.
As usual, head over to the [homepage](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/), or [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/terminator/) to get the goodness.
