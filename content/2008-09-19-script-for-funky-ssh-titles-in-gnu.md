title: Script for funky SSH titles in GNU Screen

I just uploaded a script that I've been using and refining for some while, with help from a variety of people too numerous to mention.
Basically the deal is that when you ssh somewhere from inside a GNU Screen session, the screen's title is set to the hostname you ssh'd to. Simple.
The page for the script is [here](http://www.tenshu.net/screen_ssh/)
