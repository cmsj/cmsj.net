title: Terminator 0.11 released!
slug: terminator-011-released_20

Head over to the [Terminator Homepage](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator "Terminator") to get the goodness that is version 0.11. Mostly just bugfixes this time, for things which hurt 0.10 users. Also present is support for X Session Management, although until we have proper profiling support, this is of limited use.
The source tarball is up, of course, and the Hardy/Intrepid PPAs should have packages by the time you read this.
