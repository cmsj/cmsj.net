title: Translation template updated
slug: translation-template-updated.md
date: 2008-12-22


Something that I've consistently failed at previously is uploading new translation templates in a timely fashion before a release. The translation community is absolutely fantastic and I want to make the best use of them that we possibly can, so beginning now I'm making more of a focus on regularly uploading templates to allow these multi-lingual rockstars enough time to make sure that the next release of Terminator has as much coverage as possible in your favourite language.
