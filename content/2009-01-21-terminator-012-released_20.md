I've just uploaded a new version of Terminator!
This time we merry band of elves bring you a delightful mix of bug fixes and new features. Here's the change log:
\* Bug fixes
\* Simultaneous typing support
\* Directional terminal navigation
\* Improved search UI
\* Graphical Profile Editor
\* Bug numbers for launchpad.net are now URLs
Head over to [the homepage](http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/ "Terminator Home Page") or [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/terminator/ "Terminator Project Page") for the goodness. I've already pushed out source packages to the Ubuntu PPAs, which should be spinning up buildds soon, so expect binary packages shortly. I'm sure we'll filter into Debian, Ubuntu Jaunty, Fedora, FreeBSD and more soon enough :)
