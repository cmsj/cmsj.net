title: New project released - Lifesaver

For a few days now I've been hacking away on a new project: Lifesaver.
The idea is really simple - it's a screensaver for GNOME that displays recent posts about Ubuntu from Twitter and Identi.ca. That's it!
The code and bugs and downloads live [on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/lifesaver), and packages for Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) are in [my PPA](https://launchpad.net/~cmsj/+archive/lifesaver).
Please let me know what you think!

**Update**: I had to remove the Jaunty package from the PPA because it turns out that I've been using GooCanvas features that aren't available in the Jaunty version of GooCanvas. Sorry Jaunty users, you'll have to wait until next month when Karmic is released and you upgrade!
