If you're using the Livesaver PPA I mentioned in my previous post you should shortly get offered a package of 1.1 which I'm almost ready to release.
I want to push it into the PPA first to get a little testing before officially tagging the release. Please file bugs if you spot any!
There are a few little bug fixes, the first external code contribution, and configuration is now done via gconf so you can change the fonts/colours and search keywords. I did also add a source for FriendFeed, but it's currently disabled because I don't want to extend the amount of time it takes to collect data from the web too much.
