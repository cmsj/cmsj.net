I've just chucked in a new wordpress plugin to syndicate my Launchpad project announcements (so Lifesaver and Terminator) as regular posts here so I don't need to keep writing release announcements in two places. This does mean that all the old Terminator announcements are doubled up here. I'm not sure if I'll leave it or go back and remove the dupes. Probably nobody cares anyway ;)
