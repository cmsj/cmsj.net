Yesterday I took delivery of a new Thinkpad USB keyboard because I've started putting my laptop up on a stand to be next to it's external monitor.
In so doing I needed a keyboard and the ten quid Logitech was making me very sad, hence the Thinkpad one.
If you've ever typed on a thinkpad you immediately know why this keyboard is awesome :)
