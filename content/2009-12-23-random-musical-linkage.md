I listen to a lot of electronic music and one of the nice things about that is the intermingling of other music by way of samples.
Case in point, I'm currently watching The Ballet Boyz's production of The Rite Of Spring with Rike, and I suddenly realised that the string motif playing at the entrance of The Elders is sampled and looped to great effect by the hypnotic Physical World on Freeland's album Now & Them.
This kind of thing makes me smile :)
