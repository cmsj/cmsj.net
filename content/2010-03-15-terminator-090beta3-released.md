title: Terminator 0.90beta3 released
slug: terminator-090beta3-released.md
date: 2010-03-15


We've been hard at work over the last 7 months preparing a whole new core for Terminator and it's getting close to being ready, so this is a beta release intended for testing only. Ubuntu packages have been uploaded to our test PPA ([https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive/test](https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive/test)) and a tarball is available from [http://mairukipa.tenshu.net/~cmsj/terminator/](http://mairukipa.tenshu.net/~cmsj/terminator/).
Please provide any feedback about this release to our bug tracker at [https://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/](https://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/) or our IRC channel, \#terminator on irc.freenode.net.

Caveats:
  * config files from 0.14 and earlier are currently ignored by 0.90 because the config file format has changed.
  * we now have a very basic ability to save and restore layouts, but this feature is very new and likely to contain many bugs
