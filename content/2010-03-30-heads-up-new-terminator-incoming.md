Ok folks, I suck for not getting Terminator 0.90 released earlier and I suck for not having a bunch of bug fixes for 0.14 in Ubuntu Lucid.
I'm going to fix both tonight by releasing 0.90 and begging the lovely Ubuntu Universe folks to grant an exception to get it into Lucid.
Here's hoping everything goes smoothly!
