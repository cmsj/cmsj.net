slug: terminator-092-released
date: 2010-04-07


Hot on the heels of 0.91 we have a new release for you. This is another bugfix release, stomping on as many regressions from 0.14 as we can find. Many, many thanks to all of the people who have been in touch with the project to tel us about the things that are affecting them. If you find more regressions/bugs, please let us know!
Also in this release the Palette section of the Profile editor in the Preferences GUI is now fully active, which means that all of the config file options should now be fully editable in the GUI.
