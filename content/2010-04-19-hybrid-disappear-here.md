It's a while since I wrote anything in the Music category of this blog, and since everything has been about my software projects recently, I figure it's time to mix things up a little. It's also just a few weeks since the release of the latest studio album by probably my favourite band of the last few years, [Hybrid](http://www.hybridsoundsystem.com/ "Hybrid").
The album is called Disappear Here and it's pretty damn good - I was going to describe the tracks individually, but that's what reviewers typically do and it always sounds insufferably poncy, so I suggest you just go to the [album's site](http://www.disappearhere.info "Disappear Here") and listen to the damn thing yourself ;)
They also post semi-frequent hour long DJ mixes on their [Soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/hybridsoundsystem), which I would recommend!
