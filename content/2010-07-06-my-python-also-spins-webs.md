With Terminator 0.94 released I'm turning my little brain onto an idea I have for a web service and obviously I'm sticking with python.
Clearly writing all the web gubbins by hand is mental, so I'm playing with Flask, a microframework for web apps. So far I'm really liking it, but it's taken a while to figure it and sqlalchemy out.
I'm not at all convinced that this is going to be in any way scalable, but it's a nice way to test my idea :)
