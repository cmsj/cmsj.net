Earlier on my laptop suffered a slight mishap which resulted in a key popping off. I examined the mechanism and it didn't obviously go back on by itself, so I googled around a little and landed on the helpful chaps at [laptopkey.com](http://www.laptopkey.com/installation_guides.php). I watched the video that pertains to my exact model, figured out which bits of metal had been slightly bent and a few minutes later I had everything back in working order.
It's almost a shame I didn't need to buy anything from them in return for using their helpful video ;)
