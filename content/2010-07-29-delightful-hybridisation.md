I've probably mentioned before that I really like the music of [Hybrid](http://www.hybridsoundsystem.com/ "Hybrid"), so I figured I'd pimp some stuff of theirs that's floated onto the web recently:

-   A [couple of videos](http://www.hybridsoundsystem.com/2010/07/19/glastonbury-recordings/ "Hybrid at Glastonbury 2010") from their live set at Glastonbury this year (I'm very gutted that I didn't make it to see them)
-   Their latest Frisky Radio mixtape just hit Soundcloud, [here](http://soundcloud.com/hybridsoundsystem/hybrid-june-2010 "Hybrid June 2010 Frisky Radio Mix").

Enjoy!
