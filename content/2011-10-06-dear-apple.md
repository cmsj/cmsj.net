I just woke up here in London and saw the news about Steve Jobs. It's early and, as usual for this time of day, my seven month old son is playing next to me. He has no concept of what my iPhone is, but it holds his fascination like none of his brightly coloured toys do. Only iPad can cause him to abandon his toys and crawl faster.
I'd like to thank you all, including Steve, for your work. You have brought technology to ordinary people in a way that delights them without them having to know why.
Please keep doing that for a very long time
