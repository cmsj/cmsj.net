title: Alfred 2 workflows
slug: alfred-2-workflows.md

Since I started using OS X as my primary desktop, I've loved Spotlight for launching apps and finding files. I resisted trying any of the replacement apps, for fear of the bottomless pit of customisation that they seemed to offer.
With the very recent release of Alfred 2, I was finally tempted to try it by the previews of their Workflow feature.
The idea is that you can add new commands to Alfred by writing scripts in bash/python/ruby/php and then neatly package them up and share them with others. I was expecting to write a few myself and share them, but the user community has been spinning up so quickly that they've already covered everything I was going to write.
Instead, I decided to use some time to write about the workflows I'm using so far:

-   [Google Search](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/940-google-search-in-line-results-workflow/) - get live results from Google as you type. It's not always what I want when I'm searching, but it's a very quick way to get some insight into the results available.
-   [New OmniFocus Inbox Task](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1041-create-new-task-in-omnifocus-inbox/) - Very quick way to create a new task for later triage
-   [Open SSH](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/826-ssh-with-smart-hostname-autocompletion/) - This collects up all your hosts from SSH's known\_host file, config file and local network, then opens terminal windows for you to ssh to the host you choose.
-   [Parallels Desktop](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/202-parallels-desktop-workflow/) - Easy way to start/resume your Parallels virtual machines.
-   [Rate iTunes Track](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/375-rate-itunes-track/) - does what it sounds like, rate the current iTunes track.
-   [Screen Sharing](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/942-screen-sharing-with-automatic-network-discovery/) - quickly VNC to the hosts on your network that are advertising it (including iCloud hosts if you have Back To My Mac configured)
-   [VPN Toggle](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/476-toggle-vpn/) - get on/off your corporate network quickly.

Lots more on the Alfred 2 forums. At some point it would be nice to see this unified into some kind of integrated search/download feature of Alfred 2.

Update: (2012-04-12) I've written a [second post](http://www.tenshu.net/2013/04/some-more-awesome-alfred-2-workflows.html) that covers a few more workflows I've discovered since this one.
