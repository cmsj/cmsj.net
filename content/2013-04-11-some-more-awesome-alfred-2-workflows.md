I keep finding super handy little things to do with Alfred 2 and so I thought I'd post some more:

-   [Alleyoop](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1582-alleyoop-update-alfred-workflows/?hl=alleyoop) - updates installed plugins (if the workflow author supports it, which many currently do not). Â I hope this will be a temporary workaround until a centralised workflow repository is created.
-   [Battery](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1211-battery-view-summary-stats-about-your-laptop-battery/?hl=battery) - shows all the vital stats of your MacBook's battery without having to run an app or a Terminal command.
-   [Built-in Sharing](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1805-share-using-mountain-lion-built-in-sharing-version-17/?hl=%2Bbuilt+%2Bsharing) - lets you share files directly to all the social services that OS X supports.
-   [Paste current Safari URL](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1551-paste-current-url-from-safari-into-focussed-application/?hl=%2Bpaste+%2Bcurrent+%2Bsafari) - a workflow I wrote, which pastes the URL of Safari's currently visible webpage, into the application you are using. No need to flip back and forth to copy and paste the URL
-   [Symbols](https://github.com/bevesce/unicode-symbols-search/raw/master/Symbols.alfredworkflow) - very easy, visual way to search the Unicode tables for a symbol you're looking for (e.g. arrows, hearts, snowmen, biohazard warning signs, etc)
-   [TerminalFinder](https://github.com/LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder/blob/master/TerminalFinder.alfredworkflow?raw=true) - lets you quickly get a Terminal for the Finder window you're looking at.

I imagine there will be more to come, the total number of workflows is **exploding** at the moment!
