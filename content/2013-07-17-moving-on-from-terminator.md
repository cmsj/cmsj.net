Anyone who's been following Terminator knows this post has been a long time coming and should not be surprised by it.

As of a few days ago, I have handed over the reigns of the project to the very capable Stephen J Boddy (a name that will be no stranger to followers of the Terminator changelogs - he has contributed a great deal over the last few years).

We're still working out the actual details of the handover, so for now the website is still here and I am still technically the owner of the Launchpad team that runs the project, but going forward all code/release decisions will come from Stephen and we'll move the various administrivia over to new ownership in due course.

Everyone please grab your bug trackers and your python interpreters and go send Stephen patches and feature requests! :D
