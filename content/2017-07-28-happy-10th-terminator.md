Today marks 10 years since the [very first public release](https://launchpad.net/terminator/+milestone/0.1) of [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.co.uk/p/introduction.html), a multiplexing terminal emulator project.

I started working on Terminator as a simple way to get 4 terminals to not overlap on my laptop screen. In the following years it grew many features and attracted a userbase I am very proud of.

As much as I would like to, I cannot claim most of the credit for Terminator surviving for a decade - I stepped away from the project a few years ago and handed the reigns over to Stephen Boddy at a very crucial time - gtk2 was becoming ever more obsolete and our work on a gtk3 port was very incomplete. Stephen has driven the project forward and it now has a very good gtk3 version :)

So, thank you to Stephen and everybody else who contributed code/docs/translations/suggestions/bugs/etc over the last 10 years (you can see the most active folk [here](https://launchpad.net/terminator/+topcontributors)).

I'd also like to note that according to Ubuntu's [Popularity Contest](http://popcon.ubuntu.com) data, Terminator is installed on at least 56000 Ubuntu machines. Debian also has PopCon data, but the numbers there are [a little less impressive](https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=terminator) ;)

This was the first project of mine that reached any kind of significant audience, and is the first project of mine to have achieved a decade of active maintenance, so I am feeling pretty happy today!
