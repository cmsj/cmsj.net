title: Writing a macOS Finder "action" extension with Swift 6 concurrency
slug: finder-action-swift6
date: 2025-05-23


NOTE: Some concern has been raised that this approach may be prone to deadlocks. Proceed with caution.

Swift 6 is great, but the strict concurrency checking can make interactions with older Apple APIs be... not fun.

Furthermore, older Apple APIs can be less aware of `async` Swift features, such as `actor`s. I recently ran into both of these while adding a Finder "action extension" to an app I'm working on, where the code that does the "action" (extracting a compressed archive) is in an `actor`.

Apple provides [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/add-functionality-to-finder-with-action-extensions) for this, but it assumes the actual work to be done, is synchronous. Since there wasn't a ton of relevant info online already, I figured I'd blog about it in the hopes that it can save some time for the next person who needs to do this.

After some head scratching I was able to take Appleâ€™s sample code and make it work with an actor.

Rather than write it out in pieces with explanations, I have put all the explanations in the code as commands:

```swift

//  ExtractAction

import Foundation
import UniformTypeIdentifiers
import Synchronization

// This is a function that will instantiate our actor, pass it a URL from
// Finder and return the URL of the directory it created with the extracted files
// in it.
func extract(_ url: URL) async throws -> URL? {
    // This first FileManager call is super weird, but it gives you a private, temporary
    // directory to use to write your output files/folders to.
    // (it's super weird because we don't tell it anything about the action we're currently
    // responding to, and the directory it creates is accessible to our code, but otherwise
    // not - the user can't go into this directory, nor can root).
    let itemReplacementDirectory = try FileManager.default.url(for: .itemReplacementDirectory,
                                                               in: .userDomainMask,
                                                               appropriateFor: URL(fileURLWithPath: NSHomeDirectory()),
                                                               create: true)

    // Now add the name of the archive (the last path component of `url`) to our temporary
    // directory, and create that directory. This is where we'll tell our actor to extract to
    let outputFolderName = url.deletingPathExtension().lastPathComponent.deletingPathExtension
    var outputFolderURL = itemReplacementDirectory.appendingPathComponent(outputFolderName)
    try FileManager.default.createDirectory(at: outputFolderURL, withIntermediateDirectories: true)

    // Now create our actor and ask it to extract the archive for us
    let someActor = ArchiveExtractor(for: url)
    await someActor.extract(to: outputFolderURL)

    // Return our extraction directory so the handler below can tell Finder about it.
    // Finder will then take care of moving it to the directory `url` is in, and renaming it
    // if any duplicates exist.
    return outputFolderURL
}

class ActionRequestHandler: NSObject, NSExtensionRequestHandling {
    func beginRequest(with context: NSExtensionContext) {
        NSLog("beginRequest(): Starting up...")

        // Get the input item
        guard let inputItem = context.inputItems.first as? NSExtensionItem else {
            preconditionFailure("beginRequest(): Expected an extension item")
        }

        // Get the "attachments" from the input item. These are NSItemProviders
        guard let inputAttachments = inputItem.attachments else {
            preconditionFailure("beginRequest(): Expected a valid array of attachments")
        }
        precondition(inputAttachments.isEmpty == false, "beginRequest(): Expected at least one attachment")

        // Because we have two kinds of callback closures, and they are apparently not all
        // clamped to MainActor, we need to make some thread-safe storage for the NSItemProviders
        // we need to create. Mutex will do the job nicely.
        let outputAttachmentsStore: Mutex<[NSItemProvider]> = Mutex([])

        // This is how we will schedule our final work to be done after all of our output attachments
        // have finished doing their callback closures. More on this later.
        let dispatchGroup = DispatchGroup()

        // Iterate the incoming NSItemProviders
        for attachment in inputAttachments {
            // Tell the dispatch group that we're starting a new piece of work
            // (you can also think of this as increasing a reference counter)
            dispatchGroup.enter()

            // In my case, I need to operate on mutliple UTTypes, so rather than repeat all this code
            // for ~20 types of archive, I just grab the UTType of the incoming NSItemProvider and
            // use that to load the FileRepresentation
            guard let attachmentTypeID = attachment.registeredTypeIdentifiers.first else { continue }
            NSLog("beginRequest(): Discovered source type identifier: \(attachmentTypeID)")

            // This uses the input NSItemProvider to locate the file it relates to and pass it to our closure.
            // The closure's job is to create an NSItemProvider that can be handed back to Finder, and that provider
            // is responsible for producing our output file.
            _ = attachment.loadInPlaceFileRepresentation(forTypeIdentifier: attachmentTypeID) { (url, inPlace, error) in
                // Once we have finished creating the NSItemProvider, signal to the DispatchGroup
                // that we've finished a piece of work (ie decrement a reference counter)
                defer { dispatchGroup.leave() }

                guard let url = url else {
                    NSLog("beginRequest(): Unable to get URL for attachment: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "UNKNOWN ERROR")")

                    // Even though we're passing a URL back to Finder, if we tell it it's a UTType.fileURL
                    // all it will do is write a file with the URL inside it.
                    // So instead we will vend a UTType.data.
                    // The closure for this output NSItemProvider is where we'll call our helper function from
                    // earlier.
