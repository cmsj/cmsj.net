&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to get a &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3i8l8Sz"&gt;Labists X1&lt;/a&gt; 3D printer for Christmas a few weeks ago, and it's the first 3D printer I've had or really even interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a fascinating journey so far, learning about how to calibrate a printer, how to use slicers, and how to start making my own models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that became obvious fairly quickly though, was that the printer would be more reliable with a heated bed. I've been able to get reliable prints via the use of rafts, but that adds time to prints and wastes filament, so I decided to see if I could mod the printer to have a heated bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Googling and quickly discovered that my printer is actually a rebadged &lt;a href="https://www.easythreed.com/h-col-1223.html"&gt;EasyThreed X1&lt;/a&gt; and that EasyThreed sell a &lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4000911088465.html"&gt;hotbed accessory&lt;/a&gt; for the X1, but it's an externally powered/controlled device. That's fine in theory, but I have quickly gotten very attached to being able to completely remotely control the printer via &lt;a href="https://octoprint.org/"&gt;Octoprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking inside the controller box showed a pretty capable circuit board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EasyThreed X1 controller board" src="http://cmsj.net/images/easythreed_x1_controller.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it was instantly obvious that next to the power terminal for the extruder heater, was a terminal labelled &lt;code&gt;HOT-BED&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hot bed power terminal" src="http://cmsj.net/images/easythreed_x1_terminals.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on my journey of discovery was the communication info that Octoprint was sending/receiving, among which I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Recv: echo:Marlin 1.1.0-RC3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which quickly led me to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin"&gt;Marlin&lt;/a&gt; open source project which, crucially, is licensed as GPL. For those who don't know, GPL means that since Labists have given me a binary of Marlin in the printer, they have to give me the source code if I ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Labists and they were happy to supply the source, then I also emailed EasyThreed to ask if I could have their source for the X1 as well (and while I was at it, their X3 printer, which looks a lot like the X1, but ships with a heated bed already as part of the product). They sent me the source with no real issues, so I grabbed the main Marlin repo, checked out the tag for &lt;code&gt;1.1.0-RC3&lt;/code&gt; and started making branches for the various Labists/EasyThreed source trees I'd acquired. Since their changes were a bit gratuitous in places (random whitespace changes, DOS line endings, tabs, etc) I cleaned them up quite a bit to try and isolate the diffs to code/comment changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's all GPL, I've republished their code with my cleanups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/tree/1.1.0-RC3-Labists-X1"&gt;Labists X1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/tree/1.1.0-RC3-EasyThreeD-X1"&gt;EasyThreed X1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/tree/1.1.0-RC3-EasyThreeD-X3"&gt;EasyThreed X3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific diffs aren't particularly important (although the Labists firmware does have some curious changes, like disabling thermal runaway protection), but by reading up a bit on configuring Marlin, and comparing the differences between the X3 and the X1, it seemed like very little would need to change to enable the bed heater and its temperature sensor (a header for which is also conveniently present on the controller board).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the investigation I had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A controller board with:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A power terminal for a bed heater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A header for a bed temperature sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source for the controller firmware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source for an extremely similar printer that has a bed heater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An external bed heater with power and sensor cables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad situation to be in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving into the firmware, I found that Marlin keeps most board-specific settings in &lt;code&gt;Configuration.h&lt;/code&gt; and specifically, it contains &lt;code&gt;#define TEMP_SENSOR_BED 0&lt;/code&gt;. The number that &lt;code&gt;TEMP_SENSOR_BED&lt;/code&gt; is defined as, indicates to Marlin what type of temp sensor is attached (with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; obviously meaning nothing is attached). The X3 has a value of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (a 100k thermistor), but I found that I could only get reliable readings with it set to &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; (a 10k thermistor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, that's actually the only thing that &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to change, but I did also change &lt;code&gt;#define BED_MAXTEMP 150&lt;/code&gt; because 150C seems kind of high. This define sets a temperature at which Marlin will shut itself down as a safety measure. As far as I can tell, 50C-70C is a more realistic range for PLA, and even with ABS it seems as though 110C is recommended. I haven't printed ABS yet and don't have any real plans to, so I reduced the safety limit to 100C.
I also modified the build version strings in &lt;code&gt;Default_Version.h&lt;/code&gt; so I'd be able to quickly tell in Octoprint if I had successfully uploaded a new firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next came the challenge of building the firmware. I grabbed the latest Arduino IDE, but it failed to compile Marlin correctly (perhaps because I was using the macOS version of Ardino IDE). Labists helpfully included a Windows build of Arduino IDE 1.0.5 with their firmware source, which was able to build it. Arduino IDE is also GPL, but I haven't republished that yet because I haven't audited the archive for other things that I don't have rights to distribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the firmware to upload correctly to the X1, I had to set the board type in Arduino IDE to &lt;code&gt;Melzi&lt;/code&gt; and select the COM port for its USB interface, except its USB interface wasn't showing up and Windows' Device Manager couldn't find a driver for it. Some Googling for the USB VID/PID of that device led me to the manufacturer of the CH340 chipset and &lt;a href="http://www.wch.cn/download/ch341ser_exe.html"&gt;their drivers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the moment of truth - was I about to destroy a controller board with a bad firmware/driver? I clicked the Upload button, waited for it to complete, attached the controller to my Octoprint machine again and.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Recv: echo:Marlin 1.1.0-RC3-cmsj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success! I then waited for Octoprint to start communicating with the printer and monitoring temperatures...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Recv: ok T:24.2 /0.0 B:23.6 /0.0 T0:24.2 /0.0 @:0 B@:0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who aren't familiar with Octoprint/GCode, the &lt;code&gt;T:24.2&lt;/code&gt; is the temp sensor in the extruder and the &lt;code&gt;B23.6&lt;/code&gt; is the reading from the bed sensor! Another success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After replacing the X1's 30W power supply with a 60W variant so it could power the motors &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the heater, I asked it to heat up to 50C, and after a little while....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Recv: ok T:28.1 /0.0 B:49.9 /50.0 T0:28.1 /0.0 @:0 B@:127&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the first test print I did, to make sure everything else was still working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Calibration cubes" src="http://cmsj.net/images/easythreed_x1_cubes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cubes on the left are from before the heated bed, where I was having to level the bed closer to the nozzle to get enough adhesion and the cube on the right is the first print with the heated bed. I think the results speak for themselves - much better detail retention. It's not visible, but the "elephant's foot" is gone too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a super rewarding journey, and I'm incredibly grateful to all the people in the 3D printing community upon whose shoulders I am standing. It's a rare and beautiful thing to find a varied community of products, projects and people, all working on the same goals and producing such high quality hardware and software along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;And now the tl;dr version&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do this mod to your X1, here are some things you should know, and some things you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not responsible for your printer. This is a physical and firmware mod, please be careful and think about what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy the official &lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4000911088465.html"&gt;hotbed accessory&lt;/a&gt;, open its control box and unplug the temperature sensor cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a 12V 5A barrel plug power supply (I used &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3oM2VN3"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; but there are a million options). Use this from now on to power your X1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab the modified Marlin source from my GitHub repo:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/tree/1.1.0-RC3-EasyThreeD-X1-cmsj"&gt;EasyThreed X1&lt;/a&gt; - see the precise changes from EasyThreed's firmware &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/compare/1.1.0-RC3-EasyThreeD-X1...cmsj:1.1.0-RC3-EasyThreeD-X1-cmsj"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/tree/1.1.0-RC3-Labists-X1-cmsj"&gt;Labists X1&lt;/a&gt; - this has &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/Marlin/compare/1.1.0-RC3-Labists-X1...cmsj:1.1.0-RC3-Labists-X1-cmsj"&gt;more changes&lt;/a&gt; than the EasyThreed version, since I pulled back in some of Labists changes, but left thermal runaway protection enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the CH340 USB Serial drivers. There seem to be lots of places to get these from, I used &lt;a href="http://www.wch.cn/download/ch341ser_exe.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Arduino IDE 1.0.5 - still available from the bottom of &lt;a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/OldSoftwareReleases"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Arduino IDE, open the &lt;code&gt;Marlin.ino&lt;/code&gt; file from the &lt;code&gt;Marlin&lt;/code&gt; directory and click the ✔ button on the toolbar, this will compile the source so you can check everything is installed correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the bed-levelling screws from your X1, swap the original bed for the heated one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the controller box of your X1, plug the bed's thermal sensor into the controller board in the &lt;code&gt;TB1&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wire the bed's power into the green &lt;code&gt;HOT-BED&lt;/code&gt; terminal. For the best results you probably want to unsolder the original power cable from the bed and use something thinner and more flexible (but at the very least you need something longer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reassemble the controller box and run all the wires neatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect the controller box's USB port to your PC, and in Arduino IDE click the ➡ button to compile and upload the firmware. Wait until it says &lt;code&gt;Upload complete&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory, you're done! Check the temperature readings in some software that can talk to the printer (Octoprint, Pronterface, etc.), tell it to turn the bed heater on and make sure the temps rise to the level you asked for. I would definitely encourage you to do this while next to the printer, in case something goes dangerously wrong!&lt;/li&gt;

The old address has been given out to people/companies for at least a decade, so it's simply not practical to stop receiving its email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I used the ISP's own server-side filtering to forward emails on to the new account and then delete them, however, all of the fantabulous anti-spam technologies that are used these days, conspired to make it unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, I decided that since I can access IMAP on both accounts, and I have a server at home running all the time, I'd just use some kind of local tool to fetch any emails that show up on the old account and move them to the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some investigation, I settled on &lt;a href="https://imapsync.lamiral.info/"&gt;imapsync&lt;/a&gt; as the most capable tool for the job. It's ultimately "just" a Perl script, but it's fantastically well maintained by Gilles Lamiral. It's Open Source, but I'm a big fan of supporting FOSS development, so I happily paid the 60€ Gilles asks for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strong preference these days is always to run my local services in Docker, and fortunately Gilles publishes an &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gilleslamiral/imapsync/"&gt;official imapsync Dockule&lt;/a&gt; so I set to work in Ansible to orchestrate all of the pieces I needed to get this running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first piece was a simple bash script that calls imapsync with all of the necessary command line options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is /usr/local/bin/imapsync-user-isp-fancyplace.sh&lt;/span&gt;
/usr/bin/docker run -u root --rm -v/root/.imap-pass-isp.txt:/isp-pass.txt -v/root/.imap-pass-fancyplace.txt:/fancyplace-pass.txt gilleslamiral/imapsync &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    imapsync &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        --host1 imap.isp.net --port1 &lt;span class="m"&gt;993&lt;/span&gt; --user1 olduser@isp.net --passfile1 /isp-pass.txt --ssl1 --sslargs1 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSL_verify_mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        --host2 imap.fancyplace.com --port2 &lt;span class="m"&gt;993&lt;/span&gt; --user2 newuser@fancyplace.com --passfile2 /fancyplace-pass.txt --ssl2 --sslargs2 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSL_verify_mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        --automap &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        --nofoldersizes --nofoldersizesatend &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        --delete1 --noexpungeaftereach &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
        --expunge1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please test this with the &lt;code&gt;--dry&lt;/code&gt; option if you ever want to do this - the &lt;code&gt;--automap&lt;/code&gt; option worked incredibly well for me (even translating between languages for folders like "Sent Messages"), but check that for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this script will do is start a Docker container and run imapsync within it, which will then check all folders on the old IMAP server and sync any found emails over to the new IMAP server &lt;em&gt;and then delete them from the old server&lt;/em&gt;. This is unfortunately necessary because the old ISP in question has a pretty low storage limit and I don't want future email flow to stop because we forgot to go and delete old emails. imapsync appears to be pretty careful about making sure an email has synced correctly before it deletes it from the old server, so I'm not super worried about data loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMAP passwords are read from files that live in /root/ on my server (with &lt;code&gt;0400&lt;/code&gt; permissions) and they are mounted through into the container. For the new IMAP account, this is a "per-device" password rather than the main account password, so it won't change, and is easy to revoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a complete setup yet though, because after doing one sync, imapsync will exit and Docker will obey its &lt;code&gt;--rm&lt;/code&gt; option and delete the container. What we now need is a regular trigger to run this script and while this used to mean cron, nowadays it could also mean a &lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html"&gt;systemd timer&lt;/a&gt;. So, I created a simple systemd service file which gets written to &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system/imapsync-user-isp-fancyplace.service&lt;/code&gt; and enabled in systemd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;User IMAP Sync&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;After&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;docker.service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Requires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;docker.service&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Service]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;oneshot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/usr/local/bin/imapsync-user-isp-fancyplace.sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;TimeoutSec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a systemd timer file which gets written to &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system/imapsync-user-isp-fancyplace.timer&lt;/code&gt;, and then both enabled and started in systemd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Trigger User IMAP Sync&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Timer]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;imapsync-user-isp-fancyplace.service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;OnUnitActiveSec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;10min&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;OnUnitInactiveSec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;10min&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Persistent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;[Install]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;timers.target&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will trigger every 10 minutes and start the specified service, which executes the script that starts the Dockule to sync the email. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to show a useful command, you can check when the timer last triggered, and when it will trigger next, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# systemctl list-timers&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I failed to get it working, primarily because I don't know enough of CoreAudio to get it working, and because I burned almost all of the time I had to write the app, fighting with things that, it turns out, were never going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, chalk that one up to experience I guess. Maybe the next person who has this idea will find my repo and spend their allotted time getting it to work :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the curious, the app's purpose was to be a Play Through mechanism for OS X. What is a Play Through app? It means the app reads audio from one device (e.g. a microphone or a Line In port) and writes it out to a different device (e.g. your normal speakers). This lets you use your Mac as a very limited audio mixer. I want it so the Line Out from my PC can be connected to my iMac - then all of my computer audio comes out of one set of speakers with one keyboard volume control setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the super curious, I'd be happy to get back to working on the app if someone who knows more about Core Audio than I do, wants to get involved!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Abusing Gmail as a ghetto dashboard</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2018/07/12/gmail-as-dashboard.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2018-07-12:/2018/07/12/gmail-as-dashboard.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm sure many of us receive regular emails from the same source - by which I mean things like a daily status email from a backup system, or a weekly newsletter from a blogger/journalist we like, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a great way of getting notified or kept up to date, but every one of these you receive is also a piece of work you need to do, to keep your Inbox under control. Gmail has a lot of powerful filtering primitives, but as far as I am able to tell, none of them let you manage this kind of email without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideal scenario would be that, for example, my daily backup status email would keep the most recent copy in my Inbox, and automatically archive older ones. Same for newsletters - if I didn't read last week's one, I'm realistically never going to, so once it's more than a couple of weeks stale, just get it out of my Inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Google has an indirect way of making this sort of thing work - &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/"&gt;Google Apps Script&lt;/a&gt;. You can trigger small JavaScript scripts to run every so often, and operate on your data in various Google apps, including Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I quickly wrote &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/cmsj/0d12c452277f32704f347c7fe117215a"&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; and it runs every few hours now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Configuration data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Each config should have the following keys:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  * age_min: maps to &amp;#39;older_than:&amp;#39; in gmail query terms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  * age_max: maps to &amp;#39;newer_than:&amp;#39; in gmail query terms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  * query: freeform gmail query terms to match against&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The age_min/age_max values don&amp;#39;t need to exist, given the freeform query value,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// but age_min forces you to think about how frequent the emails are, and age_max&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// forces you to not search for every single email tha matches the query&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// TODO:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  * Add a per-config flag that skips the archiving if there&amp;#39;s only one matching thread (so the most recent matching email always stays in Inbox)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After asking on the &lt;a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/104011"&gt;Apple Developer Forums&lt;/a&gt; we got an interesting response from an Apple employee that code signing might be involved. One change later to not do codesigning on Profile builds and Leaks is working again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we go, if you see "An error occurred trying to capture Leaks data" and "Unable to acquire required task port", one thing to check is your code signing setup. I don't know what specifically was wrong, but it's easy enough to just not sign local debug/profile builds most of the time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>AmigaOS 4.1 Final Edition in Qemu</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2018/07/05/amigaos41-in-qemu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T17:22:55+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2018-07-05:/2018/07/05/amigaos41-in-qemu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So this is a fun one, some marvellous hackers, including Zoltan Balaton and Sebastien Mauer have been working on Qemu to add support for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam460ex"&gt;Sam460ex motherboard&lt;/a&gt;, a PowerPC system from 2010.

&lt;p&gt;So, I bought an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and an A320M motherboard, 16GB of RAM and a micro ATX case with 8 drive bays, and set to work. That quickly proved to be a disaster because Linux wasn't stable on the AMD CPU - I hadn't even thought to check, because why wouldn't Linux be stable on an x86_64 CPU in 2018?! With that lesson learned, I swapped out the board/CPU for an Intel i7-8700 and a Z370 motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't go with FreeNAS as my previous post suggested I might, because ultimately I wanted complete control, so it's a plain Ubuntu Server machine that is fully managed by Ansible playbooks. In retrospect it was a mistake to try and delegate server tasks to an appliance like the Synology, and it was a further mistake to try and deal with that by getting the NUC - I should have just cut my losses and gone straight to a Linux server. Lesson learned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of getting lost in the weeds of purchase choices and justifications, instead let's look at some of the things I'm doing to the server with Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is root disk encryption - it's nice to know that your data is private when at rest, but a headless machine in a cupboard is not a fun place to be typing a password on boot. Fortunately I have two ways round this - firstly, a KVM (a Lantronix Spider) and secondly, one can add dropbear to an initramfs so you can ssh into the initramfs to enter the password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the playbook tasks that put dropbear into the initramfs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Install dropbear-initramfs&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;dropbear-initramfs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Install busybox-static&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;busybox-static&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The format of the ip= kernel parameter is: &amp;lt;client-ip&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;server-ip&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;gw-ip&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;netmask&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;device&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;autoconf&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;update grub&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this does rely on some external files, the important one is &lt;code&gt;zz-busybox-initramfs-fix&lt;/code&gt; which works around &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/busybox/+bug/1651818"&gt;a bug&lt;/a&gt; in the busybox build that Ubuntu is currently using. Rather than paste the whole script here, you can see it &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/cmsj/515fbf602f983e796ea11f95ce32d537"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last task in the playbook configures Linux to boot with a particular networking config on a particular NIC, so you can ssh in. Once you're in, just run &lt;code&gt;cryptsetup-unlock&lt;/code&gt; and your encrypted root is unlocked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing I'm doing, is using &lt;a href="https://github.com/borgbackup"&gt;Borg&lt;/a&gt; for some backups. It's a pretty clever backup system, and it works over SSH, so I use the following Ansible task to allow a particular SSH key to log in to the server as root, in a way that forces it to use Borg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Deploy ssh borg access&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;authorized_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;key_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;command=&amp;quot;/usr/bin/borg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;serve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;--restrict-to-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/srv/tank/backups/borg&amp;quot;,restrict&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ssh-rsa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;BLAHBLAH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;cmsj@foo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on client machines I can run &lt;code&gt;borg create --exclude-caches --compression=zlib -v -p -s ssh://gnuborg:22/srv/tank/backups/borg/foo/backups.borg::cmsj-{utcnow} $HOME&lt;/code&gt; and because &lt;code&gt;gnuborg&lt;/code&gt; is defined in &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; it will use all the right ssh options (username, hostname and the SSH key created for this purpose):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host gnuborg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  User root&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  Hostname gnubert.local&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_herborg&lt;/span&gt;

It has helped bridge the Google Nest and Netgear Arlo devices I have in my home, into my iOS devices, since neither of those manufacturers appear to be interested in becoming officially HomeKit compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London has been having a little bit of a heatwave recently and it got me thinking about the Linux server I have running in a closet under the stairs - it has pretty poor airflow available to it, and I didn't know how hot its CPU was getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by the power of JavaScript, Homebridge and Linux's &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt; filesystem, I was able to quickly whip up &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/homebridge-linux-temperature"&gt;a plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Homebridge that will read an entry from Linux's temperature monitoring interface, and present it to HomeKit. In theory I could use it for sending notifications, but in practice I'm doing that via &lt;a href="https://grafana.com/"&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt; - the purpose of getting the information in HomeKit is so I can ask Siri what the server's temperature is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration is very simple, allowing you to configure one temperature sensor per instance of the plugin (but you could define multiple instances in your Homebridge &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;accessory&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;LinuxTemperature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;gnubert&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;sensor_path&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/sys/bus/platform/devices/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;divisor&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;gnubert&lt;/code&gt; is the hostname of my server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a screenshot showing the server's CPU temperature mingling with all of the Nest and Arlo items :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, the Trello Mac app registers itself as a handler for &lt;code&gt;trello://&lt;/code&gt; URLs, so if you take any &lt;code&gt;trello.com&lt;/code&gt; board URL and replace the &lt;code&gt;https://&lt;/code&gt; part with &lt;code&gt;trello://&lt;/code&gt; you can use it as a link in your calendar (or anywhere else) and it will open the board in the app.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Homebridge in Docker, an adventure in networking</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2018/06/15/homebridge-in-docker.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2018-06-15:/2018/06/15/homebridge-in-docker.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge"&gt;Homebridge&lt;/a&gt; is a great way of connecting &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=homebridge"&gt;loads&lt;/a&gt; of devices that don't support Apple's &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/home/"&gt;HomeKit&lt;/a&gt;, to your iOS devices.

&lt;p&gt;My home server is running Ubuntu, so installing Homebridge is fairly trivial, except I run all my services in &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; containers. To make things even more fun, I don't build or manage the containers by hand - the building is done by &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/cmsj/"&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; and the containers are deployed and managed by &lt;a href="https://www.ansible.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so good, except that for a long time Homebridge used &lt;a href="https://www.avahi.org/"&gt;Avahi&lt;/a&gt; (an Open Source implementation of Apple's Bonjour host/service discovery protocol) to announce its devices. That presented a small challenge in that I didn't want to have Avahi running only in that container, so I had to bind mount &lt;code&gt;/var/run/avahi-daemon/&lt;/code&gt; into the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently rebuilt my Homebridge container to pull it up to the latest versions of Homebridge and the plugins I use, but it was no longer announcing devices on my LAN, and there were no mentions of Avahi in its log. After some digging, it turns out that the HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) library that Homebridge uses, now instantiates its own multicast DNS stack rather than using Avahi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from not actually working, this was great news, I could remove the &lt;code&gt;/var/run&lt;/code&gt; bind mount from the container, making things more secure, I just needed to figure out why it wasn't showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HAP library that Homebridge uses, ends up depending on &lt;a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/multicast-dns"&gt;this library&lt;/a&gt; to implement mDNS and it makes &lt;a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/multicast-dns/blob/master/index.js#L147"&gt;a very simple&lt;/a&gt; decision about which network interface it should use. In my case, it was choosing the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; bridge interface which explicitly isn't connected to the outside world. With no configuration options at the Homebridge level to influence the choice of interface, I had to solve the problem at the Docker network layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the answer was the following Ansible task to create a Docker network that is attached to my LAN interface (&lt;code&gt;bridge0&lt;/code&gt;) and give it a small portion of a reserved segment in the IP subnet I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p p-Indicator"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;Configure LANbridge network&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;docker_network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;lanbridge&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;macvlan&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;driver_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain"&gt;bridge0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ipam_options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;subnet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;10.0.88.0/24&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;gateway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;10.0.88.1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;iprange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;10.0.88.32/29&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then change the task for the Homebridge container to use this network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;  network_mode: lanbridge&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now Homebridge is up to date, and working, plus I have a Docker network I can use in the future if any other containerised services need to be very close to the LAN.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Receiving remote syslog events with systemd</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2018/06/15/systemd-remote-syslog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2018-06-15:/2018/06/15/systemd-remote-syslog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/"&gt;Systemd&lt;/a&gt; includes &lt;code&gt;journald&lt;/code&gt;, a fancy replacement for the venerable &lt;code&gt;syslog&lt;/code&gt; daemon (and its descendents, &lt;code&gt;syslog-ng&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rsyslog&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting, but frustrating, decision by &lt;code&gt;journald&lt;/code&gt;'s maintainers is that it does not speak the syslog network protocol, so it's unable to receive remote syslog events. Remote syslog is a tremendously useful feature for aggregating log data from many hosts on a network - I've always used it so my network devices can log somewhere I'm likely to look at, but I haven't been able to do that since &lt;code&gt;journald&lt;/code&gt; arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are many ways to skin this goose, the method I've chosen is a tiny Python daemon that listens on syslog's UDP port (514), does minimal processing of the data and then feeds it into &lt;code&gt;journald&lt;/code&gt; via its API, to get the data as rich as possible (since one of &lt;code&gt;journald&lt;/code&gt;'s strengths is that it can store a lot more metadata about a log entry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/cmsj/e03b6d28325ce5c3d5b255256278a330"&gt;here is the source&lt;/a&gt; for the daemon, and &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/cmsj/71f987d1129c5dc693243dd1aa5f8f4f"&gt;here is the systemd service file&lt;/a&gt; that manages it - note that it runs as an unprivileged user, with the sole privilege escalation of being able to bind to low port numbers (something only root can do normally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daemon is certainly not perfect (patches welcome!), but it works. Here is a &lt;code&gt;journald&lt;/code&gt; log entry from one of my UniFi access points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Jun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gnubert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;U7PG2,802aa8d48ab3,v3.9.27.8537&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;23506&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;4251792.410000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wifi1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;FWLOG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;58855274&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BEACON_EVENT_SWBA_SEND_FAILED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

If you've never used it before, Lua's C API is designed to be very simple to integrate with other code, but it also places a fairly high burden on developers to integrate it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that Lua remains simple is by being stack based - when you give Lua a C function and make it available to call from Lua code, you have to conform to a particular way of working. The function arguments supplied by the user will be presented to you on a stack, and when your C code has finished its work, the return values must have been pushed onto the stack. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;someUsefulFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Fetch our first argument from the stack&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;someNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_tointeger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Fetch our second argument from the stack&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;someString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_tostring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Do some useful work here */&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Push two return values onto the stack and return 2 so Lua knows how many return values we provided&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pushstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;some result text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pushinteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario of calling from Lua→C, Lua creates a pseudo-stack for you, so while it's good practice to keep the stack neat and tidy (i.e. remove things from it that you don't need), it's not critical because apart from the return values, the rest of the stack is thrown away. That pseudo-stack only has 20 slots by default though, so if you're pushing a lot of return arguments, or using the stack for other things, you may need to use &lt;code&gt;lua_checkstack()&lt;/code&gt; to grow it larger, up to the maximum (2048 slots).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where things get more interesting, is when you're interacting with the Lua stack without having crossed a Lua→C boundary. For example, maybe you're in a callback function that's been triggered by some event in your C program, and now you need to call a Lua function that the user gave you earlier. This might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;globalLuaFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;someCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Fetch a pointer to the shared Lua state object&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_shared_lua_state_provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Push onto the stack, the Lua function previously supplied by the user, from Lua&amp;#39;s global registry&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_rawgeti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LUA_REGISTRYINDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;globalLuaFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Push the two arguments for the Lua function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pushinteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pushstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Call the Lua function, telling Lua to expect two arguments&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly more complex than the last example, but still manageable. Unfortunately in practice this is a fairly suboptimal implementation of a C→Lua call - storing things in the &lt;code&gt;LUA_REGISTRYINDEX&lt;/code&gt; table is fine, but it's often nicer to use multiple tables for different things. The big problem here though is that &lt;code&gt;lua_call()&lt;/code&gt; doesn't trap errors. If the Lua code raises an exception, Lua will &lt;code&gt;longjmp&lt;/code&gt; to a panic handler and &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt; your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, writing this a bit more completely, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;luaCallbackTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;globalLuaFunctionRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;someCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Fetch a pointer to the shared Lua state object&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_shared_lua_state_provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Push onto the stack, the table we keep callback references in, from Lua&amp;#39;s global registry&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_rawgeti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LUA_REGISTRYINDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;luaCallbackTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Push onto the stack, from our callback reference table, the Lua function previously supplied by the user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_rawgeti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;globalLuaFunctionRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Push the two arguments for the Lua function&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pushinteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pushstring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Protected call to the Lua function, telling Lua to expect two arguments&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pcall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so this is looking better, we have our own table for neatly storing function references and we'll no longer &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt; if the Lua function throws an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we now have a problem, we're leaking at least one item onto Lua's stack and possibly two. Unlike in the Lua→C case, we are not operating within the safe confines of a pseudo-stack, so anything we leak here will stay permanently on the stack, and at some point that's likely to cause the stack to overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is the kicker - stack overflows are really hard to find by default, you don't typically get a nice error, your program will simply leak stack slots until the stack overflows, far from the place where the leak is happening, then segfault, and your backtraces will have very normal looking Lua API calls in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to handle the stack properly, the above could would actually look like this (and note that we've gone from four Lua API calls in the first C→Lua example, to eight here):&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Remove the Lua error message from the stack *THIS WAS LEAKED IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE*&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;lua_pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammerspoon has been having problems like this for the last few months - lots of crash reports that on the surface, look like completely valid code was executing. I have to admit that it took me a lot longer than it should have, to realise that these were Lua stack overflows rather than my initial suspicion (C heap corruption), but we figured it out eventually and have hopefully fixed all of the leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how did we discover that the problem was stack overflows, and how did we discover where all of the leaks were without manually auditing all of the places where we make C→Lua transitions (of which there are over 100). The answer to the first question is very simple, by defining &lt;code&gt;LUA_USE_APICHECK&lt;/code&gt; when compiling Lua, it will do a little extra work to verify its consistency. Crucially, this includes calling &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt; with a helpful message when the stack overflows. We turned this on for developers in March and then released 0.9.61 with it enabled, in early April. It's not normally recommended to have the API checker enabled in production because it calls &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt;, but we felt that it was important to get more information about the crashes we couldn't reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few days we started getting crash reports with the words &lt;code&gt;stack overflow&lt;/code&gt; in them (as well as a few other errors, which we were able to fix), but that is only half the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having discovered that we did definitely have a stack leak somewhere, how did we discover where it was? This did involve a little brute force effort, but thankfully not a full manual audit of all 107 C→Lua call sites. Instead, I wrote two macros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define _lua_stackguard_entry(L) int __lua_stackguard_entry=lua_gettop(L);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define _lua_stackguard_exit(L) assert(__lua_stackguard_entry == lua_gettop(L));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very simple to use - you call &lt;code&gt;_lua_stackguard_entry()&lt;/code&gt; just after you've obtained a pointer to the Lua state object, and then you call &lt;code&gt;_lua_stackguard_exit()&lt;/code&gt; at every point where the function can return after that. It records the size of the stack (&lt;code&gt;lua_gettop()&lt;/code&gt;) at the entry point and &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt;s that it's the same at the exit point (&lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt; also calls &lt;code&gt;abort()&lt;/code&gt; if something is wrong, so now we would get crash logs with the crash in the actual function where the leak is happening).
These entry/exit calls were then added to all 107 call sites 4 days after the 0.9.61 was released and I spent 3 evenings testing or manually verifying every site, before releasing 0.9.65 (0.9.62-0.9.64 fixed some of the other bugs found by the API checker in the mean time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing we're only 24 hours past the release of 0.9.65, but so far things are looking good - no strange Lua segfault crash reports as yet. There was one issue found today where I'd placed a &lt;code&gt;_lua_stackguard_exit()&lt;/code&gt; call after a C statement that seemed unimportant, but actually caused an important object to be freed, but that is &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/commit/95a13554c65568aca2ee6db040895c6345b01b50"&gt;already fixed&lt;/a&gt; and will be included in 0.9.66.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming we have now fixed the problem, after months of head-scratching, and a few weeks of research, testing and coding, it turns out that across the 107 call sites we only had two stack leaks - &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/commit/2b7abf2b33e3ddb17d87e548725959a8bba1ac40#diff-d0e4e7c56ae114494056acc9758d118fR797"&gt;one was in the code that handles tab completion in Hammerspoon's Console window&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/commit/f199351538d7b81bd4a01f349ddeb2e33e76d8e7"&gt;the other was in &lt;code&gt;hs.notify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully you're all enjoying a more stable Hammerspoon experience, but I think we'll be leaving both the API checker and the stack guard macros enabled since they make it very easy to find/fix these sorts of bugs. I'd rather get a smaller number of crashes sooner, than have more months of head-scratching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working on Terminator as a simple way to get 4 terminals to not overlap on my laptop screen. In the following years it grew many features and attracted a userbase I am very proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I would like to, I cannot claim most of the credit for Terminator surviving for a decade - I stepped away from the project a few years ago and handed the reigns over to Stephen Boddy at a very crucial time - gtk2 was becoming ever more obsolete and our work on a gtk3 port was very incomplete. Stephen has driven the project forward and it now has a very good gtk3 version :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank you to Stephen and everybody else who contributed code/docs/translations/suggestions/bugs/etc over the last 10 years (you can see the most active folk &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/terminator/+topcontributors"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also like to note that according to Ubuntu's &lt;a href="http://popcon.ubuntu.com"&gt;Popularity Contest&lt;/a&gt; data, Terminator is installed on at least 56000 Ubuntu machines. Debian also has PopCon data, but the numbers there are &lt;a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=terminator"&gt;a little less impressive&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first project of mine that reached any kind of significant audience, and is the first project of mine to have achieved a decade of active maintenance, so I am feeling pretty happy today!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>USB Type C is awful</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2017/06/30/usb-c-is-awful.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2017-06-30:/2017/06/30/usb-c-is-awful.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Intentionally inflammatory title there, but there are some valid reasons to be annoyed at USB Type C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I have discovered (the hard way) that although there are many cables on sale, the majority of Type C cables do not support even USB 3.0 speeds (so 5Gb/s) let alone USB 3.1gen2 (so 10Gb/s) speeds. They are actually USB 2.0 (so 480Mb/s) cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand that some &lt;em&gt;devices&lt;/em&gt; with Type C connectors may only need USB 2.0 speeds, but for the &lt;em&gt;cables&lt;/em&gt; to not all be USB 3.x seems crazy to me. Even &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLL82AM/A/usb-c-charge-cable-2-m"&gt;Apple is doing this&lt;/a&gt; - the charging cables for MacBooks (12" and Pros) with Type C ports, only support USB 2.0 speeds. If I had to guess, I'd say it's because they wanted the cables to be thin and easily bendable, which full USB 3.1 cables tend not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, unlike Type A, which marks USB 3.x cables by having blue plastic inside the connectors, there is no way to tell what speed a Type C cable is by looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, USB Type C is a &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; more powerful beast than previous versions - a modern Type C port can be capable of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40Gb/s Thunderbolt 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DisplayPort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10Gb/s USB 3.1gen2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100W of (actively negotiated) power delivery in either direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DisplayPort "alternate mode" can deliver 4K at 60Hz with USB3.1 at the same time, or 5K with USB2.0 at the same time, or 8K (compressed). When used as Thunderbolt, Type C can carry 5K video as well as the PCI data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while one tiny &lt;em&gt;connector&lt;/em&gt; can do a whole bunch of really impressive things, the &lt;em&gt;cables&lt;/em&gt; are now expected to do vastly more than even USB3.0 Type A cables, let alone USB 2.0, and it seems like that advanced capability isn't currently aligned with the history of USB as being an ultra-cheap, mass market affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various awesome folk have put together &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1vnpEXfo2HCGADdd9G2x9dMDWqENiY2kgBJUu29f_TX8/pubhtml#"&gt;a spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; of the chargers/cables they've tested, and it seems like a serious chunk of the Type C cables currently on the market, are junk. This is bad for everyone, especially users, who can buy what looks like the right cable, only to discover that their devices either don't work at all, or work to slowly, or won't charge properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post exists because I needed a USB3.0, three metre, Type A to Type C cable, and I bought one on Amazon, only to discover that it only supported USB2.0. After &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; too much searching, I eventually found an Anker cable which meets my requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part one in a series of posts about some hardware I recommend (or otherwise!) for people who want to bring some semi-professional flair to their home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first topic is storage - specifically, Network Attached Storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I was running a Mac Mini with two 3TB drives in a RAID1 array in a LaCie 2big Thunderbolt chassis (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQD0HM2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00KQD0HM2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=cmsj-20&amp;amp;linkId=263d4ed10fb9c73f39e787d9266f3851"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KYFU5YM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00KYFU5YM&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=cmsj-21&amp;amp;linkId=9290f58318a0bfd748de49c6e53c8f2c"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;), with the Mac running macOS Server to provide file sharing (AFP and SMB), and Time Machine backups for the rest of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very nice solution, in that the Mac was a regular computer, so I could make it do whatever I wanted, but it did have the drawbacks that the Thunderbolt chassis only had two drive bays, and I had trouble getting the Mac to run reliably for months at a time (I ran into GPU related kernel panics, perhaps because it was attached to a TV rather than a monitor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time I was selecting the Mac/LaCie, most NAS devices in a similar price range were very underpowered ARM devices, and could do little more than share files, but in 2017 almost all NAS devices are much more powerful x86 devices that often have extensive featuresets (e.g. running containers, VMs, hardware accelerated video transcoding, etc.) so I decided it was time to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up choosing a Synology DS916+ (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EMZHLZU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01EMZHLZU&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=cmsj-20&amp;amp;linkId=4bc9ac2f2590480e49aef6993329eb39"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01EMZHLZU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01EMZHLZU&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=cmsj-21&amp;amp;linkId=a5a66e7532a51fb5478e07202daa05d2"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;), popped one of the 3TB drives (Western Digital Red (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JJLW4M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008JJLW4M&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=cmsj-20&amp;amp;linkId=d2d3d7db9bcd9bdf879a213d405a343b"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008JJLW4M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008JJLW4M&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=cmsj-21&amp;amp;linkId=c644f89fe12d6b3d39794ca77b65cb9a"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;)) out of the LaCie and into the Synology, and set about migrating my data over. I then moved the other drive, and put in two more 3TB drives, all of which are running as a single Synology Hybrid RAID volume with a BTRFS filesystem (note that the Hybrid RAID really seems to just be RAID5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I configured the Synology to serve files over both AFP and SMB, and enabled its support for Time Machine via AFP. I was also able to connect both of its Ethernet ports to my switch (a ZyXEL GS1900 24 port switch, which I will cover in an upcoming post) and enabled LACP on each end to bond the two connections into a single 2Gb link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how did it work out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFP file sharing is great, and works flawlessly. SMB is a little more complex, because recent versions of macOS tend to enforce encryption on SMB connections, which makes them go much slower, but this &lt;a href="https://dpron.com/os-x-10-11-5-slow-smb/"&gt;can be disabled&lt;/a&gt;. I tested Time Machine over SMB, which is officially supported by Synology, but is a very recent addition, and it proved to be unreliable, so that is staying on AFP for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I was particularly keen on, with the Synology, was that it has an "app store" and one of the available applications is Docker. I was running a few UNIX daemons on the Mac Mini which I wanted to keep, and Docker containers would be perfect for them, however, I discovered that the version of Docker provided by Synology is pretty old and I ran into a strange bug that would cause dockerd to consume all available CPU cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the containers are running on an Intel NUC (which will also be covered in an upcoming post) and the Synology is focussed on file sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synology's NAS products are based on Linux, Samba, netatalk and a variety of other Open Source projects, with their custom management GUI on top. They do &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dsgpl/files/Synology%20NAS%20GPL%20Source/"&gt;publish source&lt;/a&gt;, but it's usually a little slow to arrive on the site, and it's not particularly easy (or in some cases even possible) to rebuild in a way that lets you actively customise the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I like the Synology, but I think if I'd known about the Docker issue, I might have built my own machine and put something like &lt;a href="http://www.freenas.org/"&gt;FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; on it. More work, less support, but more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent 5-8 drive Synologies now support running VMs, which seems like a very interesting prospect, since it ought to isolate you from Synology's choices of software versions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Hyper Key in macOS Sierra with Karabiner Elements</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2017/06/13/karabiner-elements-sierra-hyper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2017-06-13:/2017/06/13/karabiner-elements-sierra-hyper.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nadeau.tv/configure-hyper-key-osx/"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; have used &lt;a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/"&gt;Karabiner&lt;/a&gt; to remap Caps Lock to cmd+shift+opt+ctrl, which is such an unusual combination of modifier keys, that it effectively makes Caps behave as a completely new modifier (which we have collectively called "Hyper", in reference to old UNIX …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nadeau.tv/configure-hyper-key-osx/"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; have used &lt;a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/"&gt;Karabiner&lt;/a&gt; to remap Caps Lock to cmd+shift+opt+ctrl, which is such an unusual combination of modifier keys, that it effectively makes Caps behave as a completely new modifier (which we have collectively called "Hyper", in reference to old UNIX workstation keyboards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a time, it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came macOS Sierra, which changed enough of the input layers of its kernel, that Karabiner was unable to function. Thankfully, Karabiner's author, Fumihiko Takayama, began work on a complete rewrite of Karabiner, which is currently called &lt;a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements"&gt;Karabiner Elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Elements only supported very simple keyboard modifications - you could swap one key for another, but that was it. Various folk quickly got to work offering &lt;a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/pull/170"&gt;quick hacks&lt;/a&gt; to get a Hyper key to work, and others started to try to &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2016/09/29/a-better-hyper-key-hack-for-sierra/"&gt;work around&lt;/a&gt; the missing support, with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very glad to say that it is now possible to do a proper Hyper remap with Karabiner Elements (and to be clear, none of this is my work, all credit goes to Fumihiko).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how you can get it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install &lt;a href="https://pqrs.org/latest/karabiner-elements-latest.dmg"&gt;https://pqrs.org/latest/karabiner-elements-latest.dmg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the Karabiner Elements app, go to the Misc tab and check which version you have, if it's less than 0.91.1, click either &lt;code&gt;Check for updates&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Check for beta updates&lt;/code&gt; until you get offered 0.91.1 or higher, then install that update and re-launch the Karabiner Elements app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You probably want to remove the example entry in the Simple Modifications tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the &lt;code&gt;simple_modifications&lt;/code&gt; section, and right after it, paste in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;complex_modifications&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;rules&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;manipulators&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Change caps_lock to command+control+option+shift.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;key_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;caps_lock&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;modifiers&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;any&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;to&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;key_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;left_shift&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;modifiers&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;left_command&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;left_control&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;left_option&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;basic&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as you save the file, Elements will notice it has changed, and reload its config. You should immediately have a working Hyper key 😁&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not confident at your ability to hand-merge JSON like this, and don't need anything from Elements other than the basic defaults, plus Hyper, feel free to grab &lt;a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cmsj/23ca8a570c060e8ccb2a36cee70ed28b/raw/60cb590411193f24a56fb8f52f96093c5191ba22/karabiner.json"&gt;my config&lt;/a&gt; and drop it in &lt;code&gt;~/.config/karabiner/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supplemental note for High Sierra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only tested this very briefly on High Sierra, but I had to disable SIP to get the Elements &lt;code&gt;.kext&lt;/code&gt; to load. I'm not quite sure what's going on, but I reported it &lt;a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/777"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. (Note that you can re-enable SIP after the kext has been loaded successfully once)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people like to turn Caps into Hyper, but also have it behave as Escape if it is tapped on its own. As of Karabiner Elements 0.91.3 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ttscoff/status/875029764377108480"&gt;this appears&lt;/a&gt; to be possible by adding this to the manipulator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;to_if_alone&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;key_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;escape&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;modifiers&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;optional&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;any&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The reality of using the bus is a little more complex - getting three kids ready to go out, is a nightmare and it's not made any easier by checking a travel app on your phone to see how close the bus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think there is much I can do to make the preparation of the children any less manic, but I can certainly do something about the visibility of information about buses, mainly thanks to the excellent open APIs/data provided by &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/"&gt;Transport For London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, armed with their API, a Python 3 interpreter and a &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;, I set out to make a little box for the kitchen wall which will show when the next 3 buses are due to arrive outside our house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/pibus"&gt;The code itself&lt;/a&gt; is easy enough to throw together because Python has libraries for everything (it also helps if you don't bother to design a decent architecture!). &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; to fetch the bus data from TfL, &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html"&gt;json&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601"&gt;iso8601&lt;/a&gt; to parse the data, &lt;a href="https://python-pillow.github.io/"&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt; to render it as an image, and &lt;a href="https://apscheduler.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;APScheduler&lt;/a&gt; to give it a simple run-loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes, how to display the data. The easiest answer would be a little LCD screen, but that brings with it the downside of having a backlight in the kitchen, which would be ugly and distracting, and it also raises the question of viewing angles. Another answer would be some kind of physical indicator, but that requires skills I don't have time for. Instead, I decided to look for an E-Ink display (think &lt;a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;) - it would let me display simple images without producing light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first option I looked at was the &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pisupply/papirus-the-epaper-screen-hat-for-your-raspberry-p"&gt;PaPiRus&lt;/a&gt;, but it's in the window between its crowdfunding drive having finished, and being available to buy. The only other option I could find was the &lt;a href="http://www.percheron-electronics.uk/shop/e-paper-hat/"&gt;E-Paper HAT&lt;/a&gt;, from Percheron Electronics, which also started life as a crowdfunding project, but is actually available to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these displays are super fragile, which I discovered by destroying the first one, but Neil at Percheron was super helpful and I quickly had a new display and some tips about how to avoid cracking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My visualisation of this data isn't going to win any awards for beauty, but it serves its purpose by showing a big number to tell us how many minutes we have, and I managed to minimise the number of times you see the white-black-white refresh cycle of the eInk display with partial screen updates.
Here are some photos of the project in various stages of construction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Freshly assembled out of the box" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_6856.JPG"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The smallest USB WiFi adapter I've ever seen!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Modified PiBow case" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_6858.JPG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sadly I had to make some modifications to the PiBow case to fit this particular rPi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Running an eInk test program" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_6864.JPG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Running one of the eInk display test programs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was rather hoping I could use the famous font that TfL (and London Transport before it) use, which is known as Johnston, but sadly they will not licence the font outside their own use and use by contracted partners. There is a third party clone of the font, but it may have legal issues, presumably because TfL values their braaaaaand. Instead, I decided to just drop the idea of shipping a font with the code, and exported Courier.ttf from my laptop to the Pi directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TfL font" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_6897.JPG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This would have been nice, but I cannot have nice font things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did briefly try Ubuntu Mono, which is a lovely font, but the zeros look like eyes and it freaked me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PIBUS IS WATCHING YOU" src="http://cmsj.net/images/Screenshot_2015-12-08_14.03.28.png"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PIBUS IS WATCHING YOU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display needs to handle various different situations, most obviously, when no data can be fetched from the API. Rather than get too bogged down in the details of whether our Internet connection is down, TfL's API servers are down, London is on fire, or it's just night time and there are no buses, I went for a simple message with a timestamp. Once this has been displayed, the code skips any further screen updates until it has valid data again. This makes it easy to see when a problem occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Date message" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_7010.JPG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Maybe aliens stole the Internet, maybe it's a bus strike. It doesn't matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also render a small timestamp on valid data screens too, showing when the last data fetch happened. This is mostly so I can be sure that the fetching code isn't stuck somehow. Once I trust the system a bit more, this can probably come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Final design" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_7012.JPG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The final design, showing a fallback for when there is data for  0 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 3 buses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Three buses" src="http://cmsj.net/images/IMG_7013.JPG"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Data for three buses, plenty of time to get ready for the second one!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is, project completed! Grab the code from &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/pibus"&gt;https://github.com/cmsj/pibus&lt;/a&gt;, install the requirements on a Pi, give money to the awesome Percheron Electronics for the E-Paper HAT (and matching PiBow case), throw a font in the directory and edit the scripts for the bus stop and bus route that you care about!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sending iMessages and SMS through Messages.app with AppleScript</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2015/02/20/send-imessage-and-sms-with-applescript.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:02+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2015-02-20:/2015/02/20/send-imessage-and-sms-with-applescript.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was searching around for ways to automate sending iMessages, so I could write a plugin for &lt;a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/"&gt;Hammerspoon&lt;/a&gt;.

I found various scripts lurking around the place for sending iMessages, but I also found one that can send SMS if you have SMS Relay enabled (which means you need OS X 10.10 and an iPhone running iOS 8.1).
I figured I'd collect them as a single post, to help future searchers, so without further ado, here are two stripped down AppleScript snippets that let you control Messages.app to send either an iMessage, or an SMS.
Firstly, sending an iMessage:&lt;/p&gt;

The Nexus 4 (made by LG, sold by Google) had very respectable specs when it was launched, but its price was surprisingly low ($300 off contract). We were told this was because it was being sold very close to cost price.
The Moto X (made by Motorola, which is owned by Google) has mid-range specs, but its price is surprisingly high ($200 up front *and* an expensive two year contract).
Overall Motorola is probably getting something like $400-$600 for each Moto X sold, when you factor in the carrier subsidy.
The inevitable question is why Google is happy to make almost no money off the Nexus 4, but wants to have its Motorola division make a respectable margin on the Moto X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it because doing otherwise would undermine the carriers' abilities to sell other phones, so they would refuse to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it because Google wants the Motorola division to look good in their accounts, which is easier if you are selling mid-range phones for the kind of money that an iPhone sells for?&lt;/li&gt;

In some ways the current Mac Pro is already quite modular - at least compared to every other Mac/MacBook. You have easy access to lots of RAM slots, you have multiple standards-compliant disk bays, PCI slots and CPU sockets.
This affords the machine an extremely atypical level of upgradeability and expandability, for a Mac. Normal levels for a PC though.
Even with that modularity in mind, the machine itself is fairly monolithic - if you do need more than 4 disk drives, or more PCI cards than it can take, you have limited or no expansion options. You could burn a PCI slot for a hardware disk controller and attach some disks to it externally, but you are quickly descending into an exploding mess of power supplies, cables and cooling fans.
If Apple decides to proceed along that route, the easiest and most obvious answer is that they slim down the main Pro itself and decree that all expansion shall take place over Thunderbolt (currently 10Gb/s bidirectional, but moving to 20Gb/s bidirectional later this year when the Thunderbolt 2 Falcon Ridge controllers launch). This is a reasonable option, but even though Thunderbolt is essentially an external PCI-Express bus, its available bandwidth is considerably lower than the peak levels found on an internal PCI-E bus (currently around 125Gb/s).
A much better option, it would seem to me, would be to be able to go &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;radically&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; modular and expand the Mac itself, but how could that be possible? How can you just snap on some more PCI slots if you want those, or some more disks if that's what you need?
I will say at this point that I have absolutely no concrete information and I am not an electronic engineer, so what you read below is poorly informed speculation and should be treated as that :)
I think the answer is Intel's QuickPath Interconnect (QPI), a high bandwidth (over 200GB/s), low latency point-to-point communication bus for connecting the main components of an Intel based computer.
If you have any Intel CPU since around 2009, you probably have a QPI bus being used in your computer. Looking at the latest iteration of their CPUs, QPI is always present - on the uniprocessor CPUs it is used on the chip package to connect the CPU core to the elements of the northbridge that have migrated into the CPU package (such as the PCI-Express controller), however, on these chips the QPI bus is not presented externally.
On the multiprocessor-capable chips, it is, and is the normal way to interconnect the CPUs themselves, but it can be used for other point-to-point links, such as additional north bridges providing PCI-Express busses.
So you could buy a central module from Apple that contains 1, 2 or 4 CPUs (assuming Ivy Bridge Xeons) and all of the associated RAM slots, with maybe two minimal disk bays for the core OS to boot from, and a few USB3.0 and Thunderbolt ports. For the very lightest of users, this would likely be a complete computer - you have some disk, some RAM, CPUs and assuming the Xeons carry integrated GPUs, the Thunderbolt ports can output video. It would not be much of a workstation, but it would essentially be a beefed up Mac Mini.
I would then envision two kinds of modules that would stack on to the central module. The simplest kind would be something like a module with a disk controller chip and a load of disk bays and, not needing the raw power of QPI, this would simply connect to the existing PCI-Express bus of the main module.
There would clearly be a limit to how many of these modules you could connect, since there are a limited number of PCI-E lanes provided by any one controller (typically around 40 lanes on current chipsets), but with the second type of module, you could then take the expansion up a considerable number of notches.
That second kind would have a large and dense connector that is a QPI. These modules could then attach whatever they wanted to the system - more CPUs (up to whatever maximum is supported by that generation of Xeon - likely 8 in Ivy Bridge), or very very powerful IO modules. My current working example of this is a module that is tasked with capturing multiple 4K video streams to disk simultaneously.
This module would provide its own PCI-Express controller (linked back to the main module over QPI), internally connected to a number of video capture chips/cards and to one or more disk controller chips/cards which would connect to a number of disk bays. It sounds a lot like what would happen inside a normal PC, just without the CPU/RAM and that's because it's exactly that.
This would allow for all of the video capture to be happening within the module. It would be controlled as normal from the software running in the main module, which would be issuing the same instructions as if the capture hardware was on the main system PCI-E bus, causing the capture cards to use DMA to write their raw video directly to the disk controller exactly as if they were on the main system PCI-E bus. The difference would be that there would be no other hardware on the PCI-E bus, so you would be able to make reasonable promises around latency and bandwidth, knowing that no user is going to have a crazy extra set of cards in PCI slots, competing for bandwidth. Even if you have two of these modules capturing a really silly amount of video simultaneously. It's a model for being able to do vast amounts of IO in parallel in a single computer.
There would almost certainly need to be a fairly low limit on the number of QPI modules that could attach to the system, but being able to snap on even two or three modules would elevate the maximum capabilities of the Pro to levels far beyond almost any other desktop workstation.
As a prospective owner of the new Mac Pro, my two reasonable fears from this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They go for the Thunderbolt-only route and my desk looks like an awful, noisy mess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They go for the radical modularity and I can't afford even the core module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(While I'm throwing around random predictions, I might as well shoot for a name for the radical modularity model. I would stick with the Lightning/Thunderbolt IO names and call it Super Cell)
Edit: I'd like to credit Thomas Hurst for helping to shape some of my thinking about QPI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>My attempt at iPad repair.</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2013/05/01/my-attempt-at-ipad-repair.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2013-05-01:/2013/05/01/my-attempt-at-ipad-repair.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="//storify.com/cmsj/my-attempt-at-ipad-repair"&gt;View the story "My attempt at iPad repair" on Storify&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Alfred 2 clipboard history</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2013/04/30/alfred-2-clipboard-history.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2013-04-30:/2013/04/30/alfred-2-clipboard-history.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The toweringly awesome Alfred 2 app for OS X has a great clipboard history browser.

&lt;p&gt;It's been a very long road since Terminator 0.96 back in September 2011, but I'm very happy to announce that Terminator 0.97 was released over breakfast this morning.
There's a reasonable amount of change, but almost all of it is bug fixes and translations.
Here is the changelog:
-   Allow font dimming in inactive terminals
-   Allow URL handler plugins to override label text for URL context menus
-   When copying a URL, run it through the URL handler first so the resulting URL is copied, rather than the original text
-   Allow users to configure a custom URL handler, since the default Gtk library option is failling a lot of users in non-GNOME environments.
-   Allow rotation of a group of terminals (Andre Hilsendeger)
-   Add a keyboard shortcut to insert a terminal's number (Stephen J Boddy)
-   Add a keyboard shortcut to edit the window title (Stephen J Boddy)
-   Add an easy way to balance terminals by double clicking on their separator (Stephen J Boddy)
-   Add a plugin to log the contents of terminals (Sinan Nalkaya)
-   Support configuration of TERM and COLORTERM (John Feuerstein)
-   Support reading configuration from alternate files (Pavel Khlebovich)
-   Allow creation of new tabs in existing Terminator windows, using our DBus API
-   Support the Solarized colour palettes (Juan Francisco Cantero Hutardo)
-   Translation support for the Preferences window
-   Lots of translation updates (from our fantastic translation community)
-   Lots of bug fixes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sincere thanks to everyone who helped out with making this release happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Some of you might be wondering why this release isn't called 1.0, as it was tagged for a while in the development code. The main reason is that I just wanted to get a release out, without blocking on the very few remaining bugs/features targeted for the 1.0 release. I hope we'll get to the real 1.0 before very long (and certainly a lot quicker than the gap between 0.96 and 0.97!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do think that the Terminator project is running out of steam. Our release cadence has slowed dramatically and I think we should acknowledge that. It's entirely my fault, but it affects all of the userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on driving Terminator to the 1.0 release, but the inevitable question is what should happen with the project after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that, like the original projects that inspired Terminator (gnome-multi-term, quadkonsole, etc.), technology is moving under our feet and we need to keep up or we will be obsolete and unable to run on modern open source desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very large amount of work required to port Terminator to using both Gtk3 and the GObject Introspection APIs that have replaced PyGtk. Neither of these porting efforts can be done in isolation and to make matters more complicated, this also necessitates porting to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure that I can commit to that level of effort in a project that has, for my personal needs, been complete for about 5 years already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, if you think you are interested in the challenge, and up to the task of taking over the project, please talk to me (email cmsj@tenshu.net or talk to Ng in #terminator on Freenode). My suggestion would be that a direct, feature-complete port to Python3/Gtk3/GObject would immediately bump the version number to 2.0 and then get back to thinking about features, bug fixes and improving what we already have.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Some more awesome Alfred 2 workflows</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2013/04/11/some-more-awesome-alfred-2-workflows.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2013-04-11:/2013/04/11/some-more-awesome-alfred-2-workflows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I keep finding super handy little things to do with Alfred 2 and so I thought I'd post some more:&lt;/p&gt;

I resisted trying any of the replacement apps, for fear of the bottomless pit of customisation that they seemed to offer.
With the very recent release of Alfred 2, I was finally tempted to try it by the previews of their Workflow feature.
The idea is that you can add new commands to Alfred by writing scripts in bash/python/ruby/php and then neatly package them up and share them with others. I was expecting to write a few myself and share them, but the user community has been spinning up so quickly that they've already covered everything I was going to write.
Instead, I decided to use some time to write about the workflows I'm using so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/940-google-search-in-line-results-workflow/"&gt;Google Search&lt;/a&gt; - get live results from Google as you type. It's not always what I want when I'm searching, but it's a very quick way to get some insight into the results available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1041-create-new-task-in-omnifocus-inbox/"&gt;New OmniFocus Inbox Task&lt;/a&gt; - Very quick way to create a new task for later triage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/826-ssh-with-smart-hostname-autocompletion/"&gt;Open SSH&lt;/a&gt; - This collects up all your hosts from SSH's known_host file, config file and local network, then opens terminal windows for you to ssh to the host you choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/202-parallels-desktop-workflow/"&gt;Parallels Desktop&lt;/a&gt; - Easy way to start/resume your Parallels virtual machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/375-rate-itunes-track/"&gt;Rate iTunes Track&lt;/a&gt; - does what it sounds like, rate the current iTunes track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/942-screen-sharing-with-automatic-network-discovery/"&gt;Screen Sharing&lt;/a&gt; - quickly VNC to the hosts on your network that are advertising it (including iCloud hosts if you have Back To My Mac configured)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/476-toggle-vpn/"&gt;VPN Toggle&lt;/a&gt; - get on/off your corporate network quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots more on the Alfred 2 forums. At some point it would be nice to see this unified into some kind of integrated search/download feature of Alfred 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than just waste the 5.25" bay behind the LCD, I wanted to try and put some storage in there, particularly since the Microserver's BIOS can be &lt;a href="http://www.avforums.com/forums/networking-nas/1521657-hp-n36l-microserver-updated-ahci-bios-support.html"&gt;modified&lt;/a&gt; to enable full AHCI on the 5th SATA port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the Icy Box &lt;a href="http://www.raidsonic.de/en/products/ssd.php?we_objectID=8206"&gt;IB-RD2121StS&lt;/a&gt;, a hilarious piece of hardware. It's the size and shape of a normal 3.5" SATA disk, but the back opens up to take two 2.5" SATA disks. These disks can then be exposed either individually, or as a combined RAID volume (levels 0 or 1). Since I happen to have a couple of 1TB 2.5" disks going spare, this seemed like the perfect option, as well as being so crazy that I couldn't not buy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LCD is a red-on-black pre-made 5.25" bay insert from &lt;a href="http://www.lcdmodkit.com/"&gt;LCDModKit&lt;/a&gt;. It has an &lt;a href="http://www.harbaum.org/till/lcd2usb/index.shtml"&gt;LCD2USB&lt;/a&gt; controller, which means it's very well supported by projects like &lt;a href="http://ssl.bulix.org/projects/lcd4linux/"&gt;lcd4linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lcdproc.org/"&gt;lcdproc&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with an internal USB connector (intended to connect directly to a motherboard LCD port), except the Microserver's internal USB port is a regular external Type A port. Fortunately converters are easy to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hadn't properly accounted for in my earlier simulator work is that the real hardware only has space for 8 user-definable characters and I was using way more than that (three of my own custom icons, but lcd4linux's split bars and hollow graphs use custom characters too). Rather than curtail my own custom icons, I chose to stop using hollow graphs, which seems to have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than wait for the thing to arrive I've gone ahead and started making the config I want with lcd4linux.
Since the LCD I'm getting is only 20 characters wide and 4 lines tall, there is not very much space, so I've had to get pretty creative with how I'm displaying information.
One thing I wanted was to show the percentage used of the various disks in the machine, but since I have at least 3 mount points, that would either mean scrolling text (ugly) or consuming ¾ of the display (inefficient).
It seemed like a much nicer idea to use a single line to represent the space used as a percentage and simple display each of the mounts in turn, but unfortunately lcd4linux's "Evaluator" syntax is not sufficiently complex to be able to implement this directly, so I faced the challenge of either writing a C plugin or passing the functionality off to a Python module.
I tend to think that this feature ought to be implemented as a C plugin because it makes it easier to use, but I am unlikely to bother with that because I prefer Python, so I went with a Python module :)
The code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/lcd4linux_rotator"&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt; and the included README.md covers how to use it in an lcd4linux configuration.
At some point soon I'll post my lcd4linux configuration - just as soon as I've figured out what to do with the precious 4th line. In the mean time, here is a video of the rotator plugin operating on the third line (the first line being disk activity and the second line being network activity):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I figured out what to do with the fourth line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's another python module, this time a port of Chris Applegate's &lt;a href="http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/toys/dailymail/"&gt;Daily Mail headline generator&lt;/a&gt; from JavaScript to Python. Code is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmsj/dailymail"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be quite a long post, but hopefully interesting to a particular crowd of people.
I'm going to tell you all about how I have designed and built a paperless workflow for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came about some months ago when I needed to find several important documents that were spread through the various organised files that I keep things in. The search took much longer than I would have liked, partly because I am not very efficient at putting paper into the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could suggest that I just get better at doing that, but even if I were to do that, it still only makes me quicker at finding paperwork from the files on my shelf. If I want to really kick things up a gear, the files need to be electronic, accessible from anywhere and powerfully searchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about what I would want. Obviously a scanner was going to be the first pre-requisite of being able to digitise my papers, but what kind to get? After investigating what other people had already said about paperless workflows, it seemed like the ScanSnap range of scanners was a popular choice, but they are quite expensive and it's one more thing on my desk. Instead I decided to go for a multi-function inkjet printer - they have scanners that are good enough, and even though they're bigger than a ScanSnap, I'm also getting a printer in the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which one to get? Well that depended on which features were important. My highest priority in this project was that the process of taking a document from paper to my laptop had to be as simple as possible, so in the realms of scanning devices, that means you need one which can automatically scan both sides of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turns out to be quite rare in multi-function printers, but after a great deal of research, I found the Epson Stylus Office BX635FWD which has a duplex ADF (Automatic Document Feeder), is very well supported in MacOS X, and is a decent printer (which, for bonus points, supports Apple's AirPrint and Google's Cloud Print standards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup of the Epson was extremely pleasing - it has a little LCD screen and various buttons, which meant that I could power it up and join it to my WiFi network without having to connect it to a computer via USB at all. I then added it as a printer on my laptop (which was easy since the printer was already announcing itself on the WiFi network) and OS X was happy to do both printing and scanning over WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then investigated the Epson software for it and found that I didn't have to install a giant heap of drivers and applications, I could pick and choose which things I had. Specifically I was interested in whether I could react to the Scan button being pressed on the printer, even though it was not connected via USB. It turns out that this is indeed possible, via a little application called EEventManager. With that setup to process the scans to my liking (specifically, Colour, 300DPI, assembled into a PDF and saved into a particular temporary directory), the hardware stage of the project was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ability to turn paper into a PDF with a couple of button presses on the printer itself, I was ready to figure out what to do with it next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people with a focus on paperless workflows (such as &lt;a href="http://www.macsparky.com/"&gt;David Sparks&lt;/a&gt;) have rightly pointed out, there are several stages to a paperless workflow - capture, processing and recall. At this point I had the capture stage sorted, so the next one is processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a PDF with scanned images inside it, you obviously can't do anything with the text on the pages, it's not computer-readable text, it's a picture, but it turns out that it is possible to tell the PDF what the words are and where they are on the page, which makes the text selectable. So my attention turned to OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. I didn't engage in a particularly detailed survey because I came across a great deal on Nuance's PDF Converter For Mac product and was so impressed with its trial copy that I snapped up the deal and forged ahead. I hear good things about PDFPen, but I've never tried it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a directory full of scanned documents and some OCR software is a good place to be, but it's not a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; place to be unless you can automate it. Fortunately, OS X has some pretty excellent automation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic all happens in a single Automator workflow configured as a Folder Action on the directory that EEventManager is saving the PDFs into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Workflow" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sLYIV-dYOiY/T_Byq6UQyMI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/m50LF3zChRg/s640/ocr-archive-workflow.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will find any PDF files in that temporary folder, then loop over them, opening each one in Nuance PDF Converter, run the OCR function then save the PDF. The file is then moved to an archive directory and renamed to a generic date/time based filename. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, that's it. If you've been paying attention, at this point you'll say "but wait, you said there was a third part of a paperless workflow - you need tools to recall the documents later!". You would be right to say that, but the good news is that OS X solves this problem for you with zero additional effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the PDF is saved with the computer-readable text that the OCR function produces, it is indexed by the system's search system - Spotlight. Now all you need to do is hit Cmd-Space and type some keywords, you'll see all your matching documents and be able to get a preview. You can also open the search into a Finder window and see larger previews, change the sorting, edit the search terms, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that is it, there are future things I'd like to do - specifically I don't currently have an easy way to pull in attachments from emails, or downloaded PDFs, I have to go and drag them into the archived folder and optionally rename them. However, if you have your email hooked into the system email client (Mail.app) then it is being indexed by Spotlight, including attachments, so there's no immediate hurry to figure out a solution for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do also like the idea of detecting specific keywords (e.g. company names) in the documents and using those to file the PDFs in subdirectories, but I'm not sure if I actually need/want it, so for now I'm sticking with one huge directory of everything.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Photo import workflow</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2012/07/01/photo-import-workflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T19:57:13+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2012-07-01:/2012/07/01/photo-import-workflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I'm writing about workflows today, I thought I'd also quickly chuck in a guide to how I get the photos and movies that I've taken with my iPhone, onto my laptop and specifically, imported into Aperture.
The Mechanics
This requires a few moving parts to produce a final workflow. The high-level process is:
1.  Plug iPhone into a USB port
2.  Copy photos from the iPhone into a temporary directory, deleting them as they are successfully retrieved
3.  Import the photos into Aperture, ensuring they are copied into its library and deleted from the temporary directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, right? Well yes and no.
&lt;strong&gt;Retrieval from iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really ought to be easier than it is, but at least it is possible.
Aperture can import photos from devices, but it doesn't seem to offer the ability to delete them from the device after import. That alone makes it not even worth bothering with if you don't want to build up a ton of old photos on your phone.
OS X does ship with a tool that can import photos from camera devices and delete the photos afterwards, a tool called AutoImporter.app, but you won't find it without looking hard. It lives at:
&lt;code&gt;/System/Library/Image Capture/Support/Application/AutoImporter.app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run that tool, you will see no window, just a dock icon and some menus. Go into its Preferences and you will be able to choose a directory to import to, and choose whether or not to delete the files:
&lt;img alt="prefs" src="http://cmsj.net/images/autoimporter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy!
&lt;strong&gt;Importing into Aperture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves using Automator to build a Folder Action workflow for the directory that AutoImporter is pulling the photos into. All it does is check to see if AutoImporter is still running and if so wait, then launch Aperture and tell it to import everything from that directory into a particular Project, and then delete the source files:
&lt;img alt="Aperture autoimport workflow" src="http://cmsj.net/images/aperture-autoimport-workflow.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, that's all there is. Now whenever you plug in your iPhone, all of the pictures and movies you've taken recently, will get imported into Aperture for you to process, archive, touch-up, export or whatever else it is that you do with your photos and movies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>A sysadmin talks OpenSSH tips and tricks</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2012/02/07/sysadmin-talks-openssh-tips-and-tricks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-20T10:16:45+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2012-02-07:/2012/02/07/sysadmin-talks-openssh-tips-and-tricks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;My take on more advanced SSH usage&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I figured that I ought to pony up and write about some of the more advanced tricks that I have either used or seen others use. These will most likely be relevant to people who manage tens/hundreds of servers via SSH. Some of them are about actual configuration options for OpenSSH, others are recommendations for ways of working with OpenSSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generate your ~/.ssh/config&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't strictly an OpenSSH trick, but it's worth noting. If you have other sources of knowledge about your systems, automation can do a lot of the legwork for you in creating an SSH config. A perfect example here would be if you have some kind of database which knows about all your servers - you can use that to produce a fragment of an SSH config, then download it to your workstation and concatenate it with various other fragments into a final config. If you mix this with distributed version control, your entire team can share a broadly identical SSH config, with allowance for each person to have a personal fragment for their own preferences and personal hosts. I can't recommend this sort of collaborative working enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Generate your ~/.ssh/known_hosts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows on from the previous item. If you have some kind of database of servers, teach it the SSH host key of each (usually something like &lt;code&gt;/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub&lt;/code&gt;) then you can export a file with the keys and hostnames in the correct format to use as a &lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt; file, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;server1.company.com 10.0.0.101 ssh-rsa BLAHBLAHCRYPTOMUMBO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then associate this with all the relevant hosts by including something like this in your &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host *.mycompany.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/generated_known_hosts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    StrictHostKeyChecking yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings some serious advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safer - because you have pre-loaded all of the host keys and specified strict host key checking, SSH will prompt you if you connect to a machine and something has changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discoverable - if you have tab completion, your shell will let you explore your infrastructure just by prodding the Tab key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep your private keys, private, private&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like it ought to be more obvious than it perhaps is... the private halves of your SSH keys are very privileged things. You should treat them with a great deal of respect. Don't put them on multiple machines (SSH keys are cheap to generate and revoke) and don't back them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know your limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to write a config snippet that applies to a lot of hosts you can't match with a wildcard, you may end up with a very long &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; line in your ssh config. It's worth remembering that there is a limit to the length of lines: 1024 characters. If you're going to need to exceed that, you will have to just have multiple &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; sections with the same options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set sane global defaults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;HashKnownHosts no&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host *&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    GSSAPIAuthentication no&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    ForwardAgent no&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are very sane global defaults:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Known hosts hashing is good for keeping your hostnames secret from people who obtain your &lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt; file, but is also really very inconvenient as you are also unable to get any useful information out of the file yourself (such as tab completion). If you're still feeling paranoid you might consider tightening the permissions on your &lt;code&gt;known_hosts&lt;/code&gt; file as it may be readable by other users on your workstation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GSSAPI is very unlikely to be something you need, it's just slowing things down if it's enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agent forwarding can be tremendously dangerous and should, I think, be actively and passionately discouraged. It ought to be a nice feature, but it requires that you trust remote hosts unequivocally as if they had your private keys, because functionally speaking, they do. They don't actually have the private key material, but any sufficiently privileged process on the remote server can connect back to the SSH agent running on your workstation and request it respond to challenges from an SSH server. If you keep your keys unlocked in an SSH agent, this gives any privileged attacker on a server you are logged into, trivial access to any other machine your keys can SSH into. If you somehow depend on using agent forwarding with Internet facing servers, please re-consider your security model (unless you are able to robustly and accurately argue why your usage is safe, but if that is the case then you don't need to be reading a post like this!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notify useful metadata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using a Linux or OSX desktop, you either have something like &lt;code&gt;notify-send(1)&lt;/code&gt; or Growl for desktop notifications. You can hook this into your SSH config to display useful metadata to yourself. The easiest way to do this is via the &lt;code&gt;LocalCommand&lt;/code&gt; option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host *&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    PermitLocalCommand yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    LocalCommand /home/user/bin/ssh-notify.sh %h&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will call the &lt;code&gt;ssh-notify.sh&lt;/code&gt; script every time you SSH to a host, passing the hostname you gave, as an argument.  In the script you probably want to ensure you're actually in an interactive terminal and not some kind of backgrounded batch session - this can be done trivially by ensuring that &lt;code&gt;tty -s&lt;/code&gt; returns zero. Now the script just needs to go and fetch some metadata about the server you're connecting to (e.g. its physical location, the services that run on it, its hardware specs, etc.) and format them into a command that will display a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sidestep overzealous key agents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of SSH keys in your ssh-agent (e.g. more than about 5) you may have noticed that SSHing to machines which want a password, or those which you wish to use a specific key that isn't in your agent, can be quite tricky. The reason for this is that OpenSSH currently seems to talk to the agent in preference to obeying command line options (i.e. &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt;) or config file directives (i.e. &lt;code&gt;IdentityFile&lt;/code&gt; or PreferredAuthentications). You can force the behaviour you are asking for with the &lt;code&gt;IdentitiesOnly&lt;/code&gt; option, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host server1.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    IdentityFile /some/rarely/used/ssh.key&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    IdentitiesOnly yes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(on a command line you would add this with &lt;code&gt;-o IdentitiesOnly=yes&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Match hosts with wildcards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to talk to a lot of almost identically-named servers. Obviously SSH has a way to make this easier or I wouldn't be mentioning this. For example, if you needed to ssh to a cluster of remote management devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host *.company.com management-rack-??.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    User root&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    PreferredAuthentications password&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will match anything ending in &lt;code&gt;.company.com&lt;/code&gt; and also anything that starts with &lt;code&gt;management-rack-&lt;/code&gt; and then has two characters, followed by &lt;code&gt;.company.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Per-host SSH keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have some machines where you have a different key for each machine. By naming them after the fully qualified domain names of the hosts they relate to, you can skip over a more tedious SSH config with something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host server-??.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    IdentityFile /some/path/id_rsa-%h&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the &lt;code&gt;%h&lt;/code&gt; will be substituted with the FQDN you're SSHing to. The &lt;code&gt;ssh_config&lt;/code&gt; man page lists a few other available substitutions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use fake, per-network port forwarding hosts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have network management devices which require web access that you normally forward ports for with the &lt;code&gt;-L&lt;/code&gt; option, consider constructing a fake host in your SSH config which establishes all of the port forwards you need for that network/datacentre/etc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host port-forwards-site1.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    Hostname server1.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    LocalForward 1234 10.0.0.101:1234&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also means that your forwards will be on the same port each time, which makes saving certificates in your browser a reasonable undertaking. All you need to do is &lt;code&gt;ssh port-forwards-site1.company.com&lt;/code&gt; (using nifty Tab completion of course!) and you're done. If you don't want it tying up a terminal you can add the options &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-N&lt;/code&gt; to your command line, which will establish the ssh connection in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're using programs which support SOCKS (e.g. Firefox and many other desktop Linux apps) you can use the &lt;code&gt;DynamicForward&lt;/code&gt; option to send traffic over the SSH connection without having to add &lt;code&gt;LocalForward&lt;/code&gt; entries for each port you care about. Used with a browser extension such as FoxyProxy (which lets you configure multiple proxies based on wildcard/regexp URL matches) makes for a very flexible setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use an SSH jump host&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than have tens/dozens/hundreds/etc of servers holding their SSH port open to the Internet and being battered with brute force password cracking attempts, you might consider having a single host listening (or a single host per network perhaps), which you can proxy your SSH connections through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do consider something like this, you must resist the temptation to place private keys on the jump host - to do so would utterly defeat the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you can use an old, but very nifty trick that completely hides the jump host from your day-to-day usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host jumphost.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    ProxyCommand none&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host *.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    ProxyCommand ssh jumphost.company.com nc -q0 %h %p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might wonder what on earth that is doing, but it's really quite simple. The first &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; stanza just means we won't use any special commands to connect to the jump host itself. The second &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; stanza says that in order to connect to anything ending in &lt;code&gt;.company.com&lt;/code&gt; (but excluding &lt;code&gt;jumphost.company.com&lt;/code&gt; because it just matched the previous stanza) we will first SSH to the jump host and then use &lt;code&gt;nc(1)&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. netcat) to connect to the relevant port (&lt;code&gt;%p&lt;/code&gt;) on the host we originally asked for (&lt;code&gt;%h&lt;/code&gt;). Your local SSH client now has a session open to the jump host which is acting like it's a socket to the SSH port on the host you wanted to talk to, so it just uses that connection to establish an SSH session with the machine you wanted. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you lucky enough to be connecting to servers that have OpenSSH 5.4 or newer, you can replace the jump host &lt;code&gt;ProxyCommand&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p jumphost.company.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Re-use existing SSH connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people swear by this trick, but because I'm very close to my servers and have a decent CPU, the setup time for connections doesn't bother me. Folks who are many milliseconds from their servers, or who don't have unquenchable techno-lust for new workstations, may appreciate saving some time when establishing SSH connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that OpenSSH can place connections into the background automatically, and re-use those existing secure channels when you ask for a new &lt;code&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scp(1)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sftp(1)&lt;/code&gt; connections to hosts you have already spoken to. The configuration I would recommend for this, would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host *&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    ControlMaster auto&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    ControlPath ~/.ssh/control/%h-%l-%p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    ControlPersist 600&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will do several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ControlMaster auto&lt;/code&gt; will cause OpenSSH to establish the "master" connection sockets as needed, falling back to normal connections if something is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ControlPath&lt;/code&gt; option specifies where the connection sockets will live. Here we are placing them in a directory and giving them filenames that consist of the hostname, login username and port, which ought to be sufficient to uniquely identify each connection. If you need to get more specific, you can place this section near the end of your config and have explicit &lt;code&gt;ControlPath&lt;/code&gt; entries in earlier &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; stanzas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ControlPersist 600&lt;/code&gt; causes the master connections to die if they are idle for 10 minutes. The default is that they live on as long as your network is connected - if you have hundreds of servers this will add up to an awful lot of &lt;code&gt;ssh(1)&lt;/code&gt; processes running on your workstation! Depending on your needs, 10 minutes may not be long enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; You should make the &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/control&lt;/code&gt; directory ahead of time and ensure that only your user can access it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cope with old/buggy SSH devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have a bunch of management devices in your infrastructure and some of them are a few years old already. Should you find yourself trying to SSH to them, you might find that your connections don't work very well. Perhaps your SSH client is too new and is offering algorithms their creaky old SSH servers can't abide. You can strip down the long default list of algorithms to this to ones that a particular device supports, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Host power-device-1.company.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    HostkeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa,ssh-dss&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;That's all folks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the most useful tips and tricks I have for now. Hopefully someone will read this and think "hah! I can do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; more advanced stuff than that!" and one-up me :)&lt;/p&gt;

Since it came with virtually no documentation, and since I can't find any reference online to anyone else having had the same issue I had, I'm writing this post so Google can help future travellers.
When you are installing the card, check in the BIOS's PCI Express options that you have set it to automatically choose the right graphics card to use. I had hard coded it to use the onboard VGA controller.
The reason for this is that the RAC card is actually a graphics card, so the BIOS needs to be able to activate it as the primary card.
If you don't change this setting, what you will see is the RAC appear to work normally, but its vKVM remote video feature will only ever show you a green screen window, with the words "OUT OF RANGE" in yellow letters.

The correct thing to do is to talk to the seller first to try and resolve your problem, and then when everything is said and done, leave feedback rating the overall experience.
Several times in the last year I have gone through this process and ended up feeling the need to leave negative feedback. The most obvious case was some bluetooth headphones I'd bought from an eBay seller in China that were so obviously fake that it was hilarious he was even trying to convince me I was doing something wrong.
In each of these cases, I have been contacted shortly after the negative feedback to ask if I will remove the feedback in return for a full/partial refund.
This has tickled the curious side of my brain into wanting to know what the value of negative feedback is. The obvious way to find out would be to buy items of various different price and then leave negative feedback and see how far the sellers are prepared to go to preserve their reputations.
The obvious problem here is that this would be an unethical and unfair way to do science.

I'm officially done hosting my own Wordpress blog. Not because it's particularly hard, but because it's quite boring. I would have done a straight export/import into a wordpress.com blog, but their options for hosting on a personal domain are pretty insane - if you want to host your blog on domain.com or www.domain.com you have to just point the entire domain at the wordpress.com DNS servers.
I'm not prepared to trust my domain to a bunch of PHP bloggers, so instead I've shoved the blog over to Blogger (by way of a very helpful &lt;a href="http://wordpress2blogger.appspot.com/"&gt;online conversion tool&lt;/a&gt;), but this still presents a few niggles around URLs.
You can have Blogger send 404s to another vhost, so for now I just have a tiny little vhost somewhere else which uses mod_rewrite to catch the old page names and attempt to catch the blog post names. Ideally I'd fetch all the old post URLs and make a proper map to the new ones, but I can't really be bothered to do that, so I just went for the approximate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;RewriteRule ^/archives/(\[0-9\]{4})/(\[0-9\]{2})/(\[0-9\]{2})/(\[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\]{1,39}).\*$ http://www.tenshu.net/$1/$2/$4.html \[R=301,L\]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another obvious sticking point is that Wordpress categories become Blogger labels, so another rewrite rule can take care of them (although not so much if you've used nested categories, but again I can't really be bothered to account for that):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteRule ^/archives/category/(.)(.\*) http://www.tenshu.net/search/label/&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;$2 \[R=301,L\]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also cloudified so far is the DNS for tenshu.net - I'm trying out Amazon's Route53 and it seems to be pretty good so far. Next up will be email and then I can pretty much entirely stop faffing around running my own infrastructure :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Monitoring an Apple Airport Express/Extreme with Munin</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2011/01/29/monitoring-apple-airport-expressextreme.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2011-01-29:/2011/01/29/monitoring-apple-airport-expressextreme.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you have an Apple Airport (Express or Extreme), or a Time Capsule, and you want to monitor things like the signal levels of the connected clients?

I thought so! That's why I wrote this post, because I'm thoughtful like that.
While it's not necessary, I'd like to mention that this was made possible by virtue of Apple having put out an &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1186" title="Apple's SNMP MIB file for their Airport products"&gt;SNMP MIB file&lt;/a&gt;. Without that, finding the relevant OIDs would have been sufficiently boring that I wouldn't have bothered with this, so yay for that (even if the MIB is suspiciously ancient).
So if you don't need the MIB file, what do you need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://munin-monitoring.org" title="Munin. Monitoring for lazy people!"&gt;Munin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net-SNMP's python bindings (in Debian/Ubuntu the package name is &lt;a href="apt:libsnmp-python" title="Click here to install libsnmp-python"&gt;libsnmp-python&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my &lt;a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cmsj/+junk/munin-plugins/view/head:/snmp__airport" title="Airport SNMP plugin for Munin"&gt;airport munin plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having all of those things, how do you use it? Simple!
-   Place the munin plugin somewhere (doesn't really matter where, but the munin package probably put the other plugins in /usr/share/munin/plugins/)
-   Make sure you have a hostname or IP address for your Airport(s). If you have more than one you should either make sure they have static IPs configured, or that the one doing DHCP has static leases configured for all the other Airports.
-   Create a symlink for each of the types of graph for each of your Airports. Assuming that your Munin machine can resolve your Airport as 'myairport' you'd want to make the following symlinks:
    -   cd /etc/munin/plugins/
    -   ln -s /path/to/snmp__airport snmp_myairport_airport_clients
    -   ln -s /path/to/snmp__airport snmp_myairport_airport_signal
    -   ln -s /path/to/snmp__airport snmp_myairport_airport_noise
    -   ln -s /path/to/snmp__airport snmp_myairport_airport_rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an explicit assumption that your SNMP community is the default of 'public'. If it's not then you'll need to hack the script. Otherwise, you're done! Now you win pretty graphs showing lots of juicy information about your Airport. Yay! You're welcome ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Old and new: Mixing irssi and iPhones for fun and no profit</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/12/14/old-and-new-mixing-irssi-and-iphones.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-12-14:/2010/12/14/old-and-new-mixing-irssi-and-iphones.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use irssi for IRC and an iPhone for pocket Internets; These two choices are both excellent, but they're not terribly compatible - typing in irssi on an iPhone via SSH is quite slow and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the thing to do is run an iPhone IRC client, but then I'm signing in and out all the time and I have multiple nicknames - what I want is a way to be connected to the same IRC session as normal, but from my phone using the excellent IRC client Colloquy. By taking advantage of several different pieces of Free Software, this is entirely doable! When we're not connected to IRC, messages which trigger irssi's highlight will be forwarded to the iPhone as a Push Notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the tools we are going to use to make this happen:
-   A patched irssi (don't worry though, the patch is &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt;)
-   An irssi script (just some Perl really)
-   irssi-proxy
-   stunnel
-   Colloquy Mobile (from the iPhone App Store)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout I will be assuming that you're running Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) as this is the currently most recent LTS release and thus most suited to servers. Also it's what I run, and this is my fun evening project :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it will not be necessary to download it, I would like to note the original location of the patch and script that this method relies on. You can obtain both &lt;a href="http://static.ssji.net/colloquy_push.pl.txt" title="Colloquy Push script"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we are going to install a patched irssi from one of my PPAs, but if you do not care for this idea, the above URL will let you build your own patched irssi and contains the colloquy_push.pl script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These commands will install the patched irssi and the colloquy_push.pl script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cmsj/irssi-colloquy-push&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;sudo apt-get install irssi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you don't have &lt;code&gt;add-apt-repository&lt;/code&gt; available, it's in the &lt;code&gt;python-software-properties&lt;/code&gt; package).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Configuration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;irssi-proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to load irssi-proxy. This is distributed as a plugin library in the irssi package, you can load it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;irssiproxy_bind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;127.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;irssiproxy_password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PICKAGOODPASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;irssiproxy_ports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;network1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31337&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;network2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31338&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;network3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31339&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously you'll need to replace &lt;code&gt;PICKAGOODPASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; with a password, preferably a good one. Also you'll need to replace &lt;code&gt;network1&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;network2&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;network3&lt;/code&gt; with the names of the networks you've configured in irssi (which you can see with the command &lt;code&gt;/network list&lt;/code&gt;) and switch them to different ports if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally you should run &lt;code&gt;/save&lt;/code&gt; so irssi writes out its config file with all of these changes. Et voila, we have a running proxy, but as you noticed, we forced it to listed on 127.0.0.1, so we can't yet connect to it from the Internet. The reason we've done this is that irssi_proxy is not able to directly offer encrypted connections. It would be a bad idea to allow all our proxy password and general IRC traffic to flow around unencrypted (even though many IRC server connections are unencrypted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stunnel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stunnel is a very simple tool that lets you  add SSL support to anything listening on a TCP socket. To get started, install the &lt;code&gt;stunnel4&lt;/code&gt; package and edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/stunnel4&lt;/code&gt; and change &lt;code&gt;ENABLED=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ENABLED=1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to construct /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf. The default contains various options we don't really care about, but one important one is the &lt;code&gt;cert =&lt;/code&gt; line - we need an SSL certificate for this to work. You can either buy one or generate your own (a so-called "snake-oil" certificate). There are many guides to generating a .crt file and this is left as an exercise for the reader. With that file in place somewhere, edit stunnel.conf to point at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step for stunnel is to add port configurations. Jump to the bottom of the file and add a section like this for each of the ports irssi_proxy is listening on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[myfirststunnel]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;123.123.123.123:31337&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;127.0.0.1:31337&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have done here is told stunnel to listen on our public IP on the same port that it will then connect to on 127.0.0.1. This might seem confusing, but I think it makes sense that the port numbers stay directly mapped between tunnels and proxy ports. Restart the stunnel4 service and you should see the appropriate ports being listened on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;colloquy_push.pl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the irssi script which glues all the magic together - it receives special commands from the iPhone version of Colloquy and uses those to pass on Push Notifications when necessary. To load it, type &lt;code&gt;/script load colloquy_push.pl&lt;/code&gt; and you probably want to symlink &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/irssi/scripts/colloquy_push.pl&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colloquy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now configure a new IRC Connection in Colloquy on your iPhone. Enter its hostname/IP and the port you have stunnel listening on (the port settings are in Advanced) and enable SSL. Finally, set Push Notifications to On and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Shortcomings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script, while excellent, has one or two drawbacks - it's not yet able to detect when you're watching irssi, so it may well send lots of notifications to your phone unnecessarily (I'm looking into expanding it to detect if you're running in screen/tmux and are attached), also it doesn't have any concept of sleeping hours, so you may get woken up by notifications! Nonetheless, this is an excellent way to use your awesome iPhone and not sacrifice the magnificence of irssi!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>GStreamer thread oddness</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/10/28/gstreamer-thread-oddness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-10-28:/2010/10/28/gstreamer-thread-oddness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I sometimes find myself in a place where there are a number of Icecast streams going out at once and I'm interested in finding better ways of monitoring these.

Seriously Debian/Ubuntu developers, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; sort this out. I really don't care about the intricacies of your workflow - just make it easy for me to be an upstream developer pushing packages into a PPA. Don't make me wade through a sea of hundreds of build tools, dscs, origs, diffs, etc. Just make a bundle and shove it into Launchpad. One command. bzr2ppa in a working directory. Done.
I'm quite sure the failures I had were due either to my incorrect use of some tool or other, or an incorrect setup, but I contend that I shouldn't have to care. Such a tool just needs to know that there's a debian/ that works and a PPA waiting. Make it happen. Go. Now. Are we there yet?

Pienaar has a Puppet module on github called "concat". Its premise is very simple, it just concatenates fragments of text together into a particular file.
I'm sure that a more seasoned Puppet veteran would have had this running in no time, but since it introduced some new concepts for me, I thought I'd throw up some notes of how I'm using it. I was particularly interested in an example usage I saw which lists the puppet modules a system is using in its /etc/motd, but because of the way Ubuntu handles constructing the motd, I needed to slightly rework the example. In Ubuntu, the /etc/motd file is constructed dynamically when you log in - this is done by pam_motd which executes the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/. One of those scripts (99-footer) will simply append the contents of /etc/motd.tail to /etc/motd after everything else - my example will take advantage of this. If you are already using motd.tail, you could just have this puppet system write to a different file and then drop another script into /etc/update-motd.d/ to append the contents of that different file.
This is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;git clone http://github.com/ripienaar/puppet-concat.git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the resulting git branch to /etc/puppet/modules/concat and add it to my top-level site manifest that includes modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a class to manage /etc/motd.tail. In my setup this ends up being /etc/puppet/manifests/classes/motd.pp, which is included by my default node, but your setup is probably different. This is what my class looks like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;motd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                   &lt;span class="na"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;    # used by other modules to register themselves in the motd&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

       &lt;span class="na"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;fragment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;motd_fragment_$name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;/etc/motd.tail&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;$body &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$order&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's quite a mouthful. Let's break it down:
 * We have to include concat::setup so the concat module can...set... up :)
 * We then set a variable pointing at the location of the file we want to manage
 * We then instantiate the concat module for the file we want to manage and set properties like the ownership/mode
 * We then call the concat::fragment function for two specific fragments we want in the output - a header and a footer (although I do this on a single line, so it's the phrase "Puppet modules" and "\n\n" respectively). They're forced to be header/footer by the "order" parameter - by making sure we use a low number for the header and a high number for the footer, we get the layout we expect.
 * Outsite this class we define a function motd::register which other modules will call and the content they supply will be handed to concat::fragment with a default order parameter of 20 (which is higher than the value we used for the header and lower than the footer one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in each of my modules I include the line:
    &lt;code&gt;motd::register{"someawesomemodule":}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and now when I ssh to a node, I see a line like:
    Puppet modules: web ssh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a fairly simple little thing, but quite pleasing and from here out it's almost zero effort - just adding the motd::register calls to each module.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Adventures in Puppet: Tangled Strings</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/08/04/adventures-in-puppet-tangled-strings.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-08-04:/2010/08/04/adventures-in-puppet-tangled-strings.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am trying to do as much management on my new VM servers as possible with Puppet, but these are machines I still frequently log on to, and not everything is managed by Puppet, so it's entirely possible that in a fit of forgetfulness I will start editing a file …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am trying to do as much management on my new VM servers as possible with Puppet, but these are machines I still frequently log on to, and not everything is managed by Puppet, so it's entirely possible that in a fit of forgetfulness I will start editing a file that Puppet is managing and then be annoyed when my changes are lost next time Puppet runs.
Since prior preparation and planning prevents pitifully poor performance, I decided to do something about this.
Thus, I present a VIM plugin called TangledStrings, which I'm distributing as a Vimball (.vba) you can download from its &lt;a href="http://launchpad.net/tangledstrings" title="TangledStrings"&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; on Launchpad. For more information on Vimball formatted plugins, see &lt;a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pi_vimball.html" title="Vimball Documentation"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. To install the plugin, simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vim tangledstrings.vba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions from Vimball to type: :so %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, TangledStrings will show a (configurable) warning message when you load a Puppet-owned file:
&lt;a href="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/puppetstrings_alert.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/puppetstrings_alert.png" title="tangledstrings_alert" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11573" width="403" height="127" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This message can be disabled, and you can choose to enable a persistent message in the VIM status line instead:
&lt;a href="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tangledstrings_statusline.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tangledstrings_statusline.png" title="tangledstrings_statusline" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11574" width="403" height="127" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(or you could choose to enable both of these methods).
For more information, see the documentation included in the Vimball which you can display with the VIM command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:help TangledStrings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions, improvements, patches, etc. are most welcome!

I'm not really going to say anything about the plot, other than to advise you avoid reading anything about it until you've seen it - not because there's anything particularly secret, but because it's nice to not have any preconceptions about what might happen.
For me, the best films have me leaving the cinema totally caught up in their world, my mind reeling with the possibilities of what they have explored. Inception achieved this, and I want to see it again, although preferably at home on Bluray so I can hear every word of dialogue properly - a surprising shortcoming of one of London's flagship cinemas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Random puppetry</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/07/14/random-puppetry.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-14T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-07-14:/2010/07/14/random-puppetry.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a colleague earlier about Puppet and its ability to install packages.

I'm in constant need of debugging information and in Terminator particularly where we have lots of objects all interacting and reparenting all the time. We've had a simple dbg() method for a long time, but I was getting very bored of typing out dbg('Class::method:: Some message about %d' % foo), so I decided to see what could be done about inferring the Class and method parts of the message.
It turns out that python is very good at introspecting its own runtime, so back in January, armed with my own stupidity and some help from various folks on the Internet, I came up with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debugging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How's about that for shockingly bad? ;)
It also adds a really impressive amount of overhead to the execution time.
I added the DEBUGCLASSES and DEBUGMETHODS lists so I could cut down on the huge amount of output - these are hooked up to command line options, so you can do something like "terminator -d --debug-classes=Terminal" and only receive debugging messages from the Terminal module.
I'm not exactly sure what I hope to gain from this post, other than ridicule on the Internet, but maybe, just maybe, someone will pop up and point out how stupid I am in a way that turns this into a 2 line, low-overhead function :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>A good day</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/07/04/good-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-07-04:/2010/07/04/good-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today has been about creating, not consuming.

Apart from half-watching Primal Fear with Rike, I have spent the day fixing bugs in Terminator and playing with the Akai Synthstation app on my iPad. I suspect I'm not going to be ruling the clubs anytime soon, and the UI is pretty dreadful for composing music, but it has a good library of sounds and synth mangling knobs :)
I even filmed myself playing some of the parts and edited them together into a little music video, but it's really very poor ;)
Rike's going to be out for most of tomorrow, so I have to decide between doing more of what I've been doing today, playing PS3 games or going out myself.

&lt;p&gt;This website shares a server with various other network services that form the foundation of my online life (i.e. IRC and Email) and I've been running into capacity issues in the last few months, so I'm running an experiment whereby I upgrade to brand new hardware (Quad Core i7, 8GB of RAM) and partition the available resources across virtual machines so the various network services are isolated into logical security zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Whining&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have plenty of experience using Xen for this sort of thing, but that's becoming more and more irrelevant in newer kernels/distributions. As much as I think that's a shame and a stupid upstream decision, I can't change it, so I need to move on to KVM and libvirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Resolution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with the beefy new server booted up in a -server kernel and a big, empty LVM Volume Group I got to work creating some virtual machines. This post is mainly a reminder to myself of the things I need to do for each VM :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the steps I used to make a VM with 1GB of RAM, 10GB / and 1GB of swap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create an LVM Logical Volume&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;lvcreate -L11G -n somehostname VolumeGroup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Create a VM image and libvirt XML definition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;ubuntu-vm-builder kvm lucid --arch amd64 --mem=1024 --cpus=1 \&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;--raw=/dev/VolumeGroup/somehostname --rootsize=10240 --swapsize=1024 \&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;--kernel-flavour=server --hostname=somehostname \&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;--mirror=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ --components=main,universe \&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;--name &amp;#39;Chris Jones&amp;#39; --user cmsj --pass &amp;#39;ubuntu&amp;#39; --bridge virbr0 \&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;--libvirt qemu:///system --addpkg vim --addpkg ssh --addpkg ubuntu-minimal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catchy command, huh? ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(building the VM will take a few minutes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modify the libvirt XML definition for performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best driver for disk/networking is the paravirtualised "virtio" driver. I found that ubuntu-vm-builder had already configured the networking to use this, but not the disk, so I modified the disk section to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;disk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;block&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;device=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;disk&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dev=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;/dev/VolumeGroup/somehostname&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dev=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;vda&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;bus=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;virtio&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/disk&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Modify the libvirt XML definition for emulated serial console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really want to use VNC to talk to the console of my VMs, so I add the following to the &amp;lt;devices&amp;gt; section of the XML definition to make a virtualised serial port and consider it a console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;serial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;pty&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/serial&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;pty&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;port=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/console&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Modify the libvirt XML definition for a better CPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm running this on an Intel Core i7 (Nehalem), but libvirt's newest defined CPU type is a Core2Duo, so we'll go with that in the root of the &amp;lt;domain&amp;gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;cpu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;match=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;minimum&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;model&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;core2duo&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/model&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/cpu&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Import the XML definition into the running libvirt daemon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;virsh define /etc/libvirt/qemu/somehostname.xml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mount the VM's root filesystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Logical Volume we created should be considered as a whole disk, not a mountable partition, but dmsetup can present the partitions within it, and these should still be present after running ubuntu-vm-builder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;mkdir /mnt/tmpvmroot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;mount /dev/mapper/VolumeGroup-somehostnamep1 /mnt/tmpvmroot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fix fstab in the VM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit /mnt/tmpvmroot/etc/fstab and s/hda/vda/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure serial console in the VM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit ﻿/etc/init/ttyS0.conf and place the following in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;    # ttyS0 - getty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    #&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    # This service maintains a getty on ttyS0 from the point the system is&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    # started until it is shut down again.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    start on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=[2345]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    stop on runlevel [!2345]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    respawn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    exec /sbin/getty -L 115200 ttyS0 xterm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and look for the commented "defoptions" line. Change it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;    # defoptions=console=ttyS0 console=tty0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the default "quiet splash" is not useful for servers IMHO)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unmount the VM's root filesystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;umount /mnt/tmpvmroot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;rmdir /mnt/tmpvmroot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Start the VM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;virsh start somehostname&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;SSH into the VM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't specify any networking details to ubuntu-vm-builder, so the machine will boot and try to get an address from DHCP. By default you'll have a bridge device for libvirt called virbr0 and dnsmasq will be running, so watch syslog for the VM getting its address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cmsj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;@192.168.122&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xyz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should now be in your VM! Now all you need to do is configure it to do things and then fix its networking. My plan is to switch the VMs to static IPs and then use NAT to forward connections from public IPs to the VMs, but you could bridge them onto the host's main ethernet device and assign public IPs directly to the VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Python decisions</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/06/03/python-decisions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-06-03:/2010/06/03/python-decisions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every time I find myself hacking on some Python I find myself second guessing all sorts of tiny design decisions and so I figure the only way to get any kind of perspective on them is to talk about them.

Either I'll achieve more clarity through constructing explanations of what I was thinking, or people will comment with useful insights. Hopefully the latter, but this is hardly the most popular blog in the world ;)
So. What shall we look at first. Well, I just hacked up a tiny script last night to answer a simple question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is most of my music collection from the 90s?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously what I want to do here is examine the ID3 tags of the files in my music collection and see how they're distributed. A quick search with apt showed that Ubuntu 10.04 has two python libraries for dealing with ID3 tags and a quick play with each suggested that the one with the API most relevant to my interests was &lt;a href="apt:python-eyed3" title="Install eyeD3"&gt;eyeD3&lt;/a&gt;. After a few test iterations of the script I was getting bored of waiting for it to silently scan the roughly 4000 MP3s I have, so I did another quick search and found a &lt;a href="apt:python-progressbar" title="Install progressbar"&gt;progress bar&lt;/a&gt;library.
So that's all of the motive and opportunity established, now let's examine the means to the end. If you want to follow along at home, the whole script is &lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/musicdecades.py_.txt" title="musicdecades.py.txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;eyeD3&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;progressbar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pbar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;ImportError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;You should make sure python-eyed3 and python-progressbar are installed&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off this is the section where I'm importing the two non-default python libraries that I depend on. I want to provide a good experience when they're not installed, so I catch the exception and tell people the Debian/Ubuntu package names they need, and exit gracefully. I rename the progressbar module as I import it just because "progressbar" is annoyingly long as a name, and I don't like doing "from foo import *".
Skipping further on, we find the code that extracts the ID3 year tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Unknown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I'm really not sure about the "correctness" of; One of the reasons I went with the eyeD3 library was that the getYear() method returns None if it can't find any data, but I don't really want to capture the result, then test the result explicitly and if it's None set the value to "Unknown", so I went with the above code which only needs a single line and is (IMHO) highly readable.
This is ultimately the crux of the entire program - we've now collected the year, so we can work out which decade it's from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Unknown&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;0s&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this isn't an unknown year we chop the final digit off the year and replace it with a zero. Job done!
Next up, another style question. Rather than store the year we just processed I want to know how many of each decade have been found, so the obvious choice is a dict where the keys are the decades and the values are the number of times each decade has been found. One option would be to pre-fill the dict with all the decades, each with a value of zero, but that seems redundant and ugly, so instead I start out with an empty dict. This presents a challenge - if we find a decade that isn't already a key in the dict (which will frequently be the case) we need to notice that and add it. We could do this by pre-emptively testing the dict with its has_key() method, but that struck me as annoyingly wordy, so I went with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are incrementing a year that isn't already in the dict, python will raise a KeyError, at which point we know what's happened and know the correct value is 1, so we just set it explicitly. Seems like the simplest solution, but is it the sanest?
The only other thing I wanted to say is a complaint - having built up the dict I then want to print it nicely, so I have a quick list comprehension to produce a list of strings of the format "19xx: yy" (i.e. the decade and the final number of tracks found for that decade), which I then join together using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I hate! Why can't I do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OUTPUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(where "OUTPUT" is the list of strings). If that were possible, what I'd actually do is tack the .join() onto the end of the list comprehension and a single line would turn the dict into a printable string.
So there we have it, my thoughts on the structure of my script. I'd also add that I've become mildly obsessive about getting good scores from pylint on my code, which is why it's rigorously formatted, docstring-ed and why the variable names in the __main__ section are in capitals.
What are your thoughts?
Oh, and the answer is no, most of my music is from the 2000s. The 1990s come in second :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>gtk icon cache search tool</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/05/13/gtk-icon-cache-search-tool.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-05-13:/2010/05/13/gtk-icon-cache-search-tool.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier on this evening I was asking the very excellent Ted Gould about a weird problem with my Gtk+ icon theme - an app I'd previously installed by hand in /usr/local/, but subsequently removed, had broken icons because Gtk+ was looking in /usr/local/share/icons/ instead of /usr/share …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier on this evening I was asking the very excellent Ted Gould about a weird problem with my Gtk+ icon theme - an app I'd previously installed by hand in /usr/local/, but subsequently removed, had broken icons because Gtk+ was looking in /usr/local/share/icons/ instead of /usr/share/icons/.
We did a little digging and realised I had an icon theme cache file in /usr/local/ that was overriding the one in /usr/. A bit of deleting later and it's back, but in the process we whipped up a little bit of python to print out the filename of an icon given an icon name.&lt;/p&gt;

The album is called Disappear Here and it's pretty damn good - I was going to describe the tracks individually, but that's what reviewers typically do and it always sounds insufferably poncy, so I suggest you just go to the &lt;a href="http://www.disappearhere.info" title="Disappear Here"&gt;album's site&lt;/a&gt; and listen to the damn thing yourself ;)
They also post semi-frequent hour long DJ mixes on their &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/hybridsoundsystem"&gt;Soundcloud page&lt;/a&gt;, which I would recommend!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Writing Terminator plugins</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/04/18/writing-terminator-plugins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-04-18:/2010/04/18/writing-terminator-plugins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Terminator Plugin HOWTO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the features of the new 0.9x series of Terminator releases that hasn't had a huge amount of announcement/discussion yet is the plugin system. I've posted previously about the decisions that went into the design of the plugin framework, but I figured now would be a good time to look at how to actually take advantage of it.
While the plugin system is really generic, so far there are only two points in the Terminator code that actually look for plugins - the Terminal context menu and the default URL opening code. If you find you'd like to write a plugin that interacts with a different part of Terminator, please let me know, I'd love to see some clever uses of plugins and I definitely want to expand the number of points that plugins can hook into.
The basics of a plugin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plugin is a class in a .py file in terminatorlib/plugins or ~/.config/terminator/plugins, but not all classes are automatically treated as plugins. Terminator will examine each of the .py files it finds for a list called 'available' and it will load each of the classes mentioned therein.
Additionally, it would be a good idea to import terminatorlib.plugin as that contains the base classes that other plugins should be derived from.
A quick example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;terminatorlib.plugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;myfirstplugin&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;myfirstplugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeBasePluginClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now let's move on to the simplest type of plugin currently available in Terminator, a URL handler.
URL Handlers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of plugin adds new regular expressions to match text in the terminal that should be handled as URLs. We ship an example of this with Terminator, it's a handler that adds support for the commonly used format for Launchpad. Ignoring the comments and the basics above, this is ultimately all it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;class LaunchpadBugURLHandler(plugin.URLHandler):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  capabilities = [&amp;#39;url_handler&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  handler_name = &amp;#39;launchpad_bug&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;  match = &amp;#39;\\b(lp|LP):?\s?#?[0-9]+(,\s*#?[0-9]+)*\\b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;  def callback(self, url):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;    for item in re.findall(r&amp;#39;[0-9]+&amp;#39;, url):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;      return(&amp;#39;https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/%s&amp;#39; % item)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it! Let's break it down a little to see the important things here:
-   inherit from plugin.URLHandler if you want to handle URLs.
-   include 'url_handler' in your capabilities list
-   URL handlers must specify a unique handler_name (no enforcement of uniqueness is performed by Terminator, so use some common sense with the namespace)
-   Terminator will call a method in your class called callback() and pass it the text that was matched. You must return a valid URL which will probably be based on this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that's all there is to it really. Next time you start terminator you should find the pattern you added gets handled as a URL!
Context menu items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of plugin is a little more involved, but not a huge amount and as with URLHandler we ship an example in terminatorlib/plugins/custom_commands.py which is a plugin that allows users to add custom commands to be sent to the terminal when selected. This also brings a second aspect of making more complex plugins - storing configuration. Terminator's shiny new configuration system (based on the excellent ConfigObj) exposes some API for plugins to use for loading and storing their configuration. The nuts and bolts here are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;terminatorlib.plugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;terminatorlib.config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;available&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;CustomCommandsMenu&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CustomCommandsMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MenuItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;capabilities&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;terminal_menu&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;myconfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plugin_get_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__class__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Now extract valid data from sections{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;menuitems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;terminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;menuitems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gtk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MenuItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some jazz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simplified example, but it's sufficient to insert a menu item that says "some jazz". I'm not going to go into the detail of hooking up a handler to the 'activate' event of the MenuItem or other PyGTK mechanics, but this gives you the basic detail. The method that Terminator will call from your class is again "callback()" and you get passed a list you should add your menu structure to, along with references to the main menu object and the related Terminal. As the plugin system expands and matures I'd like to be more formal about the API that plugins should expect to be able to rely on, rather than having them poke around inside classes like Config and Terminal. Suggestions are welcome :)
Regarding the configuration storage API - the value returned by Config.plugin_get_config() is just a dict, it's whatever is currently configured for your plugin's name in the Terminator config file. There's no validation of this data, so you should pay attention to it containing valid data. You can then set whatever you want in this dict and pass it to Config().plugin_set_config() with the name of your class and then call Config().save() to flush this out to disk (I recommend that you be quite liberal about calling save()).
Wrap up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now that's all there is to it. Please get in touch if you have any suggestions or questions - I'd love to ship more plugins with Terminator itself, and I can think of some great ideas. Probably the most useful thing would be something to help customise Terminator for heavy ssh users (see the earlier fork of Terminator called 'ssherminator')&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Terminator 0.93 released!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2010/04/15/terminator-093-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2010-04-15:/2010/04/15/terminator-093-released.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another week, another release focused on squashing as many bugs as possible.

No problem you think, scanners of various kinds have been supported in Linux for a long time.
I dislike ordering hardware online because of the shipping lag and because I'm a sucker for the retail experience, so I was checking out which devices would work with Ubuntu and which devices were on sale in my local computer supermarket. The latter was a depressingly short list, and the former was getting annoying to search for, but I stumbled on the idea of a multi-function printer. It turns out that it's cheaper to buy a scanner as part of a printer than it is to buy a scanner on its own (granted the resolution of the scanner isn't quite as good, but it's more than sufficient for my needs). The reason for this is undoubtedly that the manufacturers are expecting to make up their money by selling me ink cartridges every few months.
As I started to look at models of multi-function printers, one thing became apparent almost immediately - HP have done a lot of leg work on this. I quickly found a bunch of info on their site about how they basically support all of their stuff on Linux, including a page which specifically listed popular distros and which versions worked with which printers.
I decided pretty much immediately that I wanted to support this, so off I went to the shop to buy an HP. They had the decent looking F4580 for around £40, so I nabbed that and set off home.
When I got home I fired up my laptop running Lucid and plugged the new device in. Less than 10 seconds later I was told it was ready for printing, and I fired up Robert Ancell's excellent new Simple Scan to see what configuration I would need to do to make that work.... the answer being none, it scanned a page first time.
Now smug with the ease with which that had worked I started installing the HP driver software on a popular proprietary operating system so I could use it to configure the printer's WiFi feature (something I assumed I couldn't do from within Ubuntu - an assumption that turns out to have been wrong). Ten minutes later it was still finishing off the install process, but eventually I did get the printer hooked up to our wireless network.
Back to the Lucid machine, I told it to add a new printer, it immediately saw the HP announcing itself on the network and let me quickly add that and I could print over wifi. Pretty nifty stuff.
Then I started poking around with HP's Linux Imaging and Printing software (HPLIP) and noticed that there was an "hp-toolbox" that wasn't installed. This is the tool I should have used to configure the wifi network on the printer; It also shows the ink levels and lets you kick off scanning/printing/cleaning type jobs. Out of sheer curiosity I went into hp-toolbox's preferences and changed it from using xsane to simple-scan, and told it to start a Scan. I wasn't expecting it to work because the device wasn't connected via USB, but it turns out that not only does the device support scanning over WiFi, it works in Linux. It's not quite as fast as a direct hookup, but it's certainly significantly more convenient!
So there we have it, out of the box I was up and running within 10 seconds of plugging the device in, and if I'd known to just install hp-toolbox I would have had everything running wirelessly a few minutes later. This being compared to installing CDs and dealing with great gobs of driver/application mess (I've seen HP's Windows drivers and it's no fun trying to persuade them to update themselves, or to persuade them not to prompt you to register every week). A huge, epic victory for Linux and Ubuntu - and one that I seem to find with much random consumer hardware these days. A few years ago this post would have been full of complicated commands and scripts and compilation as I described how to make the device work, but now all I can do is be smug about how easy it was :D

So there it is - trunk is now completely refactored and full of exciting new bugs. I noticed while I was working from it this afternoon that the transparency setting code wasn't working, but I expect I can get that cleared up tonight :)
Now a bunch of bug fixing and a config converter and we can release!

So if you know people who like Terminator and enjoy testing things out, all they need to do is:

I think it's finally time that we get some more eyeballs on it, mainly so I can check that I haven't massively screwed something up. I know there is lots of missing functionality right now, and probably a bunch of subtle bugs, but I could use your help quantifying exactly what these are!
If you're inclined to help, please branch &lt;em&gt;lp:~cmsj/terminator/epic-refactor&lt;/em&gt;, cd into it and run &lt;em&gt;./terminator&lt;/em&gt;, then use it like you always would and file bugs, preferably indicating clearly in the bug that you're using this branch and not trunk (maybe tag the bug '&lt;strong&gt;epicrefactor&lt;/strong&gt;').
Things I know are broken right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-e and -x command line options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all forms of drag &amp;amp; drop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;directional navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some keyboard shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I know are missing because they're not coming back:
-   Extreme tabs mode (sorry, it's just too insane to support)
-   GNOME Terminal profile reading (I'm trying to simplify our crazy config system and dropping GConf is a good way to achieve that)
-   Config file reading. At some point I'll write something that migrates old Terminator configs to the new format, but for now you'll have to live without your old config file. The new one isn't documented yet either, but it is a whole bunch better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now would also be a great time to start writing plugins for Terminator and telling me about them. I'm happy to ship good plugins, but more importantly I want feedback about the weaknesses/strengths of our plugin system. Right now you can only hook into URL mangling and the terminal context menu, but the latter of those gives you pretty serious flexibility I think. Obviously one massive weakness is a lack of documentation about the plugin API, but I'll get to that, I promise!
So there we have it, another step along the way to me being able to merge this branch into trunk and put out a real release of 0.90 and then eventually 1.0!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Python wanderings, part two</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/12/31/python-wanderings-part-two.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-12-31:/2009/12/31/python-wanderings-part-two.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;2.

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we get feature requests and merge proposals for features that are clearly useful for someone, but not appropriate for the general use cases. It's always unfortunate to have to say no to these folks, but we have a slim menu UI and I'm wary of cluttering it with niche features. Still, turning away legitimate users is something I don't like doing, so for a while we've been considering how to fix this.
The obvious answer is that we should support plugins, and I've been working on such a system for my epic refactoring. This is a quick wander through some thoughts I've had.
I started out by googling for python plugin systems; One if the top hits was &lt;a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2006/7/3/python-plugin-system"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; by Armin Ronacher . In it he demonstrates a plugin system in under 40 lines of Python. It's simple and flexible, but there are some issues, like it makes doctest very sad.
I asked about this in #python and was politely informed that I was Doing It Wrong. I chatted for a while with the helpful residents and came away with a list of plugin frameworks to look at, namely twisted.plugin and zope.interface.
Pulling in external dependencies is a big deal for us - many of our users are on Ubuntu or similar desktops with lots of python packages already installed, but some are not using GNOME or a Linux desktop at all, so we have to be sure that we need a library before we depend on it.
After playing a little with both of the options I came to the conclusion that while they are both really well made and capable, they are far more formal than we need, and the added dependency issues continued to concern me.
I revisited Armin's plugin system and removed the use of .__subclasses__() that was breaking doctest and offending #python instead having a list in each .py file which the plugin system extracts and treats any classes mentioned in that list as plugins. I also extended it to always instantiate the plugins and look for the plugin files in both the system directories and the user's home directory.
&lt;a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Ecmsj/%2Bjunk/terminator-epic-refactor/annotate/head%3A/terminatorlib/plugin.py"&gt;This plugin system&lt;/a&gt; is currently hooked into two places in the branch, URL mangling and the context menu. This allows plugins to add support for new URL types (e.g. we just added support for Launchpad code URLs like lp:~cmsj/+junk/terminator-epic-refactor), and insert new options into the context menu. I'm not sure if we need to go further, but if you would like to hook into other parts let me know - it's pretty easy to arrange now :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Python wanderings, part one</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/12/23/python-wanderings-part-one.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-12-23:/2009/12/23/python-wanderings-part-one.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my earlier post about refactoring Terminator, I want to talk about some of the things I've learned about Python and programming in the last few months.

If I were you I wouldn't place any great significance in anything I'm about to say - after all I'm a rank amateur in the field of programming.
This is going to be a multi-part post so I at least get something out there, rather than leaving it to rot forever in my drafts folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Solving global warming^W variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have objects that represent terminal widgets, objects that represent widgets that contain terminals, objects that contain configuration, and one master object that functions as the brains of the operation.
Inevitably these objects need to know about each other, but how to achieve that? The brain object is simply called 'Terminator' and almost every other part of the system needs to know about it, same with the config object, and Terminator needs to know about all of the terminal objects, etc. The dependencies are all over the place and one aim of the re-factor was to separate all these parts out and decouple them, but ultimately I was never going to get away from different objects needing to know about each other.
So how to go about it? As far as I know the options are:
-   pass around object references (every time you create something, pass it your references to all the bits it needs)
    -   Pros: no hacks or tricks involved
    -   Cons: makes every __init__() more complicated, means passing references that an object doesn't need other than to pass to its children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use global variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pros: they're global&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cons: everyone seems to hate global variables, perhaps because it's an implicit dependency not an explicit one, or because of potential namespace collisions, or maybe other reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use singletons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pros: explicit dependency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cons: often seems to involve hackery to get the singleton object reference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my searching around I came across a fourth option that somewhat relates to singletons... the Borg pattern.
This is a very simple idea - it's a class that always instantiates to the same thing. You don't need a factory or function or something that gives you a reference to the singleton, you just instantiate a class and it's the same as all of the others you've instantiated of the same class.
Best of all, the Borg pattern is incredibly simple in Python. Like, really simple. Don't believe me? Click &lt;a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66531/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Yep, four lines of code. Technically it's probably a bit ugly, but the resulting code feels very clean.
So now I have the Borg pattern in use for the main class, a class that provides all the configuration, a class that discovers plugins and lets them be referenced, and a fairly new class I'm experimenting with that acts as a factory for all of my classes, as a way to break any possibility of circular module dependencies.
Reality has to bite though, the Borg isn't a panacea; One has to be very careful about how one creates Borg objects. I chose to create a base class called Borg which Terminator, Config, Factory and PluginRegistry all derive from, but this turns out to have been a very short sighted decision to abstract out the common 4 lines. It wasn't until I started building Config to have functions that allow it to be accessed as a dict that I realised all of my Terminator, Config, Factory and PluginRegistry instances were the same thing as opposed to each type being distinct. It's also terrifyingly important that the subclasses of Borg not use class attributes. Any attributes defined by these classes *must* be instantiated as None so they are instance variables, and *after* you've called Borg.__init__(self) in your own __init__() you can then set up your attributes however you want because they are then part of the shared state.
On the whole I am happy with the Borg pattern. I've written test code to ensure that all of the assumptions I explicitly made are guaranteed, and all of the implicit assumptions I've discovered I made are also safe. Nonetheless, it's not a completely clean solution and I find myself wishing it was somehow a primitive of the language.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Random musical linkage</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/12/23/random-musical-linkage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-12-23:/2009/12/23/random-musical-linkage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I listen to a lot of electronic music and one of the nice things about that is the intermingling of other music by way of samples.

In the 3 years since then we have expanded and extended the code in a variety of directions to produce a moderately compelling feature set, but one that is really obviously incomplete.
In the same time period we've also seen a really gratifying amount of adoption - I believe our active userbase numbers in the thousands if not tens of thousands. I am forced to largely estimate these numbers for all the usual FOSS reasons, but it's all based on one real metric - Ubuntu has about a million users reporting popcon data and over 10,000 of those have Terminator installed. I don't actually think that they all use it, but nonetheless it's the kind of number that makes you think "hey maybe I need to be doing more for these folks".
And I do think that, and I am trying to do more.
Back in August I took a serious look at where we are and came to the same old conclusions - we lack one or two headline features that people keep asking for (barely a week goes by when I don't get asked how someone can save a particular layout of terminals). These features are very subtle and deeply problematic with the existing code architecture - we've just been hacking in features as we can without any regard for architecture or future maintainability.
I decided that I'd had enough of being confused and frustrated by the status quo and so I started a side branch in my Launchpad /+junk/ folder called "epic-refactor" with the aim of refactoring all of Terminator from scratch. I'd read through every line of existing code and figure out what we were actually doing and how it could fit together more sensibly, then sketch that out in the barest form possible while I experimented with various Python techniques to arrive at an architecture that makes sense for our project, then port over the existing code feature-by-feature to the new architecture.
It's now a little over four months since I started the epic refactor and looking at where I stand today I am really happy. It's not ready to be merged into trunk yet, but the amount of work to get it there is less than the amount of work I've done on it so far. I don't want to put a timescale on it, but I hope to be calling for some wider testing in 2-3 months or less.
Once we are acceptably close to feature parity with the current releases I'll merge the epic-refactor branch over  and we can start to push forward with implementing the features that everyone wants, and finally get to the point of being able to comfortably release a 1.0 version.
I'd always thought that I'd hand over maintainership after a 1.0 version, but the last 4 months have been a whirlwind of programming discovery, so I might very well just stick around and see what people want on the road to a 2.0 release. Alternatively, the work I've been doing in the last few days on a plugin system might mean that I can kick back and watch everyone else implement crazy, awesome and sublime features I'd never thought of!
I'll be back with more when I have written a configuration subsystem for epic-refactor, because by then I'll be wanting your help to test!
I'm also going to write a separate post shortly about some of the interesting Python paradigms and ideas I've hit upon along the way. I'm sure none of it will be a revelation to anyone with serious programming chops, but for a rank amateur like me it would have been useful to have read four months ago ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Terminator 0.14 released!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/12/03/terminator-014-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-12-03:/2009/12/03/terminator-014-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This has been another long gap release unfortunately, but we do have some goodies for you.

It's a comfortable thing to be looking at, and after much playing around I've settled on 6.5pt as my ideal application font size.
No problems with that, right? Fontconfig says font sizes are a double (a high precision floating point number), but not all libraries/applications follow this.
In my testing of Karmic I've found two such things that particularly stick out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;notify-osd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assumes font sizes are whole numbers, so ends up using a tiny font&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwibber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assumes font sizes are integers and completely fails to run if they are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this won't do, so I've checked that we have &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/notify-osd/+bug/396736"&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/gwibber/+bug/383759"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; (and in the case of Gwibber, a patch), but I seem to be meeting some resistance, or this just isn't considered to be a high priority.
Thus a new Launchpad team is born, &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~floatingfonters"&gt;The Floating Fonters&lt;/a&gt;, for exiles such as myself who won't kowtow to the integers. We even have &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/~floatingfonters/+archive/floatingfixes"&gt;a PPA with fixed versions&lt;/a&gt; of notify-osd and Gwibber, but no guarantees are included!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Thinkpad USB keyboard</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/10/17/thinkpad-usb-keyboard.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-10-17:/2009/10/17/thinkpad-usb-keyboard.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took delivery of a new Thinkpad USB keyboard because I've started putting my laptop up on a stand to be next to it's external monitor.

Slightly annoying perhaps, but ultimately a decision that's hard to argue with and fortunately one that's pretty easy to work around. I wish the author would clear things up once and for all because the tp_smapi module is desperately important for Thinkpad owners wishing to protect the life of their laptop battery. Given that my new X301 is tasked with a lifetime of 3 years, I am particularly keen to protect its battery!
The source for the module is still in the archive (and my understanding is that it will stay there, we just don't want to ship it by default) as tp-smapi-source, packaged by Evgeni Golov (a thoroughly decent chap who is the current owner of the Thinkpad X300 I've posted about previously). You can install it with the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;sudo apt-get install tp-smapi-source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run:
    sudo module-assistant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and select the tp-smapi module to build and install. You are now just a quick:
    sudo modprobe tp_smapi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;away from having battery charge control options in /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/
Woo! If I get a chance I'll try and produce a version of the package which uses DKMS (Dell's Kernel Module management system which makes sure that additional modules like this are rebuilt automagically whenever you get a kernel update).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Brewing Lifesaver 1.1</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/09/16/brewing-lifesaver-11.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-09-16:/2009/09/16/brewing-lifesaver-11.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're using the Livesaver PPA I mentioned in my previous post you should shortly get offered a package of 1.1 which I'm almost ready to release.

That's not to say that I haven't still got a burning interest to do good works in the FOSS world. Recently I've been poking around at other things. I've got a patch in GNOME's Bugzilla which fixes the stupid bug where mailto: URIs get mangled when you open them, and yesterday I submitted a branch to the GNOME Do folks which adds a plugin for users of Request Tracker (being a sysadmin, RT rules my working life).
Hopefully both will get merged soon!

This being a reaction to applications on the store generally trending towards $0.99 in a massive war of attrition among the 15,000 applications there. It's a market worth fighting for considering there are 5 million downloads a day, but you need to be compelling, and price is the easiest way to do that. Not necessarily the best though.
I had never heard of their apps, so I went to their site to check them out and they certainly look good - something that a lot of the apps I've tried don't, but I noticed straight away that it was basically just the same idea rehashed in a few different forms. I felt compelled to comment on their forums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to be dismissive of your work, indeed I've never tried any of your apps (nor would I, since I don't have a car, go to the gym, etc. I'm lazy and I live in a big city).
My natural reaction when I see a selection of apps such as yours is that you've had an idea and you're trying to milk it. Again, I'm not trying to be mean or cruel, it's just my gut reaction.
You appear to have some very pretty and quite flexible technology for logging events, and jotting up costs, so why is there not a single awe-inspiring app for people to do those things in the way *they* want to, not the way *you* want them to.
$5 just to keep track of fuel bills seems a bit bizarre when you can just keep a stack of paper receipts, or search your online credit card statements.
However, a generic tracking tool that lets you create arbitrary tags.... that's a whole new kettle of fish, I could be tagging any work related expenses, things that relate to clothes, or iphone apps, and it's entirely up to me to develop a workflow that I'm comfortable with.
I could also be logging when I go to the gym (if I did), and when I walk to work, which kinda counts as keeping fit, or when my washing machine breaks down so I can complain to my landlord, etc, etc.
I think it's deeply unfortunate that you're finding yourself in a situation where you feel you are undervaluing your hard work, nobody likes that kind of thing, and I don't at all doubt that a significant factor is the general race-to-the-bottom of pricing in the AppStore. At that point it seems like the best way to succeed is to stand out on quality and features. Your screenshots suggest you have the design flair to pull off a quality application, but you're deliberately trying to restrict the features in each app, so people end up buying two apps if they want to track gym and fuel events, but they still can't record their expenditure on flowers for their wife.
Make a free, or $0.99 app that lets people track two or three things, and a $5 app that lets you track as much as you want. I would buy it the $5 version and my gut feeling is that lots of other people would too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that I actually asked a Mac developer friend of mine the other day to consider making a generic kind of event logging app, because I do have infrequently recurring events I'd like to keep track off, and I might well be tempted to keep track of arbitrary groupings of expenditure if I had the facility, but I have no reason to buy an application for tracking car fuel costs, or company trip expenses. As it happens I don't have a car, but even if I did I would feel like I should be buying something that can track *anything* and creating a tag for car related expenses, and a second tag for fuel expenses, then creating events with both those tags when I fill the car up.
I guess my fundemental problem is that the iPhone is a general purpose computer, but these apps are very specific in their functionality, and that fundementally annoys me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Terminator 0.12 released!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2009/01/21/terminator-012-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2009-01-21:/2009/01/21/terminator-012-released.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sadly a small translation change slipped in at the last minute, but I'm otherwise pleased to announce the release of Terminator 0.12!

One such conversation was over lunch in a busy Google canteen with Kees Cook, one of our rocking security engineers and a thoroughly decent chap. After a while we came to the subject of Terminator and some of the features we'd like to implement, the ones that have been requested and we're not particularly motivated to work on, and the odd ones.
I was trying to remember the things people have asked us to add, that for one reason or another we probably aren't going to and mentioned one about the ability to navigate between terminals in a directional way: That is, rather than doing Ctrl-Tab to cycle through the terminals in the order they were created, you could press something to move to the terminal to the left, or above, right or below the currently focussed one.
On the surface it sounds like a good idea and probably not too tricky, but only if you think from the point of view of a grid. That really would be easy, but our UI is produced by way of a tree structure, not a grid. This means you need to do some proper thinking to figure it out. Kees' face lit up and he said something like "that sounds like a graph theory problem!" and expressed an interest in working on it.
I'm very glad to say that in just under a week after we all went home from UDS, I've just merged his results into trunk.
Thanks very much to Kees for his code and helpful suggestions (such as resurrecting Marcus Korn's simultaneous-typing branch, which I did one evening at UDS - rewriting it and then merging it into trunk). Also thanks to the other Terminator users I met there :)

I carry at least 4 CDs in my laptop sleeve and that's not really enough, plus I sometimes burn CDs to update firmwares in laptops, etc.
It doesn't sound like the end of the world, because it's not, but that doesn't mean the status quo is worth keeping. I've been thinking for a while now that it would be great to have a solid-state device I could use as a USB CDROM. I could load it up with a bunch of ISOs and boot from them without having to carry round a load of CDs or waste blank CDs for BIOS/firmware upgrades that are only a few MB.
A little research showed that, as ever, Linux was the perfect candidate because of its USB Gadget subsystem, which lets it act as USB Mass Storage, USB Ethernet, USB Serial, USB MIDI and other things.
While the Mass Storage support currently in the kernel doesn't include CDROM support, there is &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-04-usb/usb-g_file_storage-add-cd-rom-emulation.patch" title="g_file_storage CD-ROM patch"&gt;a patch&lt;/a&gt; kicking around which adds it as an option when loading the g_file_storage kernel module.
Next up - selecting some suitable hardware to test this on.
&lt;img alt="Atmel NGW100" src="http://www.avr32linux.org/twiki/pub/Main/ModifyTheNGW100/ngw_overview.png"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.atmel.no/" title="Atmel"&gt;Atmel&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4102"&gt;NGW100&lt;/a&gt; ticks all of the boxes for a test rig, it's got a serial port, a USB port, a power port and an MMC card slot. It's much bigger than a gumstix, and not powered by USB (although there is a&lt;a href="http://nickstallman.net/node/11"&gt;dubious sounding hardware hack&lt;/a&gt; for this), but this is a low cost board to prove the project is possible.
The board comes with linux pre-installed, but the kernel isn't super-new, and since the CD-ROM patch isn't in mainline yet, I needed to get the board up to date.
Fortunately there is a great community of people around embedded linux. With a bunch of googling and help from HcE on #elinux, last night I got stuck in and built a toolchain, kernel, root image and upgraded &lt;a href="http://www.atmel.no/buildroot/buildroot-u-boot.html"&gt;the bootloader&lt;/a&gt;. This morning I &lt;a href="http://support.atmel.no/knowledgebase/avr32studiohelp/com.atmel.avr32.tool.ngw100/html/firmware_upgrade.html#With_serial_link"&gt;uploaded a new image&lt;/a&gt; with a slightly old version of the CD-ROM patch (because I only just found the newer version while writing this post).
There's also plenty of information around about this, but it can be a challenge to wade into a brand new system and immediately know the right places to look (the &lt;a href="http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view"&gt;avr32linux.org wiki&lt;/a&gt; turns out to be supremely useful, as was HcE).
So the question is, does it work? The simple anwer is yes, a Linux machine sees it as a CD-ROM drive and can mount it as such. The more complex, and slightly worse answer is not yet, because a test against a BIOS didn't work. It's possible this is a &lt;a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/wiki/index.php/VBUS_fix"&gt;hardware issue&lt;/a&gt;, but it could be a software issue too, so I'm casting around for ideas :)

To put the event in context, I spent a few hours during the day with Rike, Alex and Simon in Hyde Park at the Red Bull Flügtag. We ate, we drank, we watched ridiculous people flinging themselves from a raised platform into The Serpentine in craft that almost invariably were capable solely of an ungraceful and undignified plunge. The notable exception being a poor attempt at a basic hangglider design, which somehow stalled and dived its way to a distance record.
We then said goodbye to Alex and headed half way across London toWembley Stadium, where we arrived to a bigger queue for the toilet than for the gates, so we were inside in a jiffy. We'd missed the support acts nonsense and things were gearing up for the Foos. It was a pretty impressive sight and sound to walk out onto what would normally be the pitch, amongst an almost capacity crowd (Dave Grohl seemed to think there were 86,000 people there).
Then noise, then cheering, then rock. Twenty minutes of rock go by before they take so much as a beat of a break to say hello. More rocking. Rock. Rockity rock. Rock. Special appearance by Jimmy Paige and John Paul Jones from Led Zepplin. Rock. Good night. Massive firework show.
Best gig I've ever been to, and I'm not expecting it to ever be beaten.
I would describe the show in more detail, but if you weren't there then you lose, sorry.
Except you don't lose! You can now buy a DVD or a Bluray of the show, and I am here to tell you that you absolutely should, especially if you own a Bluray player.
My copy of the Bluray arrived yesterday and I've watched the entire 2 hour show twice so far. There seem to be cameras everywhere and they're edited together well, so it's a treat to watch. The show was presented in conjunction with BBC Radio One and they broadcast it, so the sound recording is very good. What else do you care about? There are no extras, but who cares.
As if the weekend hadn't offered up enough excitement already, Simon and I went to Silverstone on the Sunday to see a day of Renault motorsport.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Using inotify in a pygtk application without pyinotify</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2008/10/24/using-inotify-in-pygtk-application.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2008-10-24:/2008/10/24/using-inotify-in-pygtk-application.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am lazy.

&lt;p&gt;You may also have searched on Google for what to do about it and come away with very little useful information.
Well no more! I did the same thing and got bored of reading mailing list posts, so read the source code instead. The relevant section is in &lt;em&gt;session.c&lt;/em&gt;:
        if (stat(component, &amp;amp;st) != 0)
          fatal("%s: stat(\"%s\"): %s", &lt;strong&gt;func&lt;/strong&gt;,
              component, strerror(errno));
        if (st.st_uid != 0 || (st.st_mode &amp;amp; 022) != 0)
          fatal("bad ownership or modes for chroot "
              "directory %s\"%s\"",
              cp == NULL ? "" : "component ", component);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite simple really, it's &lt;em&gt;stat()&lt;/em&gt;ing the directory specified for "&lt;em&gt;ChrootDirectory&lt;/em&gt;" and &lt;strong&gt;all its parents up to /&lt;/strong&gt; and checking that they are:
-   owned by &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt;
-   not &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; writable
-   (it also checks they are actually directories, but I'm going to assume you're not stupid enough to try and chroot into a file ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note my emphesis that these checks apply to the chroot directory itself and its parents and &lt;em&gt;/&lt;/em&gt;, so if you are chrooting users into /srv/chroot/ then you need to ensure that &lt;em&gt;/&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;/srv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;/srv/chroot&lt;/em&gt; are owned by root and not writable by the group (even if it's root, bizarrely) or other users.

Some devices (such as Bluetooth) can be made to entirely disappear from the USB bus, however, the fingerprint reader and webcam can't, but they sit on the USB bus and draw power.
Fortunately the USB specs allow devices to be put to sleep if they're not being used and support that feature. Unfortunately many devices advertise they support it when they really don't, so Linux is unable to automatically put every USB device to sleep.
Fortunately you can control the setting by hand, and this is how. Firstly, start off with a Terminal and run the command "lsusb":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmsj@kodachi:~$ lsusbBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 007 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 002 Device 002: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint ReaderBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hubBus 004 Device 002: ID 17ef:4807 LenovoBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hubBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hubcmsj@kodachi:~$&lt;/code&gt;
You can ignore the "&lt;em&gt;root hub&lt;/em&gt;" entries, the interesting two are "&lt;em&gt;SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader&lt;/em&gt;" (guess which device that is ;), and "&lt;em&gt;Lenovo&lt;/em&gt;" (this is the webcam).
So now we need to poke at those devices to enable their autosleeping. If we look at the entry for the webcam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bus 004 Device 002: ID 17ef:&lt;strong&gt;4807&lt;/strong&gt; Lenovo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've highlighted "&lt;em&gt;4807&lt;/em&gt;". This is the Product value for this USB device (if you're curious, the "&lt;em&gt;17ef&lt;/em&gt;" part is the Vendor value and uniquely identifies the maker of this device).
Now we need to find out where abouts the webcam lives in the &lt;em&gt;/sys/&lt;/em&gt; filesystem (which is something the kernel provides to give applications lots of information about the hardware in your system).
The following command will put us on the right path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;grep 4807 /sys/devices/*/*/usb*/*/idProduct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, on my laptop, returns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/idProduct:4807&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take that information you get, and chop the "&lt;em&gt;idProduct:4807&lt;/em&gt;" bit off the end, just leaving "&lt;em&gt;/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/&lt;/em&gt;" (yours will look a little different to this) and add "&lt;em&gt;power/level&lt;/em&gt;" to the end.
You should now have something that looks pretty much like "&lt;em&gt;/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level&lt;/em&gt;" and if you get the current setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;cmsj@kodachi:~/Desktop$ cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;cmsj@kodachi:~/Desktop$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can see it is "on", which means it will not be automatically put to sleep. To change that, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;echo &amp;quot;auto&amp;quot; | sudo tee /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and test if your device still works (so if it's a webcam, fire up "&lt;em&gt;cheese&lt;/em&gt;", or if it's a fingerprint scanner that you use, test if it still accepts your finger). If everything is good then you can put something in /etc/rc.local so the power saving will be set up every time you reboot your computer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;echo &amp;quot;auto&amp;quot; &amp;gt; /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb4/4-5/power/level&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that's it! Repeat this for all the USB devices in your laptop and enjoy the power saving (run "&lt;em&gt;powertop&lt;/em&gt;" about 10 minutes before you start doing this so it has time to get a good average of your power usage, then see how much difference this makes. It could be up to 0.5Watts per device). Note that this won't work particularly well for external USB devices you plug in, becuase the /sys/ path won't exist until you plug the device in, so you'd need to do the above steps every time you connect it.
Hopefully HAL will start whitelisting devices which can be suspended, but I don't know of any work in this direction at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid) power performance</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2008/10/09/ubuntu-810-intrepid-power-performance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2008-10-09:/2008/10/09/ubuntu-810-intrepid-power-performance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In one word: wow.

Previously I have always resisted applying tweaks to my laptop that would attempt to reduce power, but since things were improving, the temptation was simply too great and I started digging out all the resources on this (by far the most useful being the tips on Intel's grammatically horrific &lt;a href="http://www.lesswatts.org/"&gt;http://www.lesswatts.org/&lt;/a&gt;. I had two reasons for not doing this previously - firstly I didn't want to deviate too much from a default install of Ubuntu (if only because it makes it much harder to reproduce bugs), but secondly I kept running into little weirdnesses. The most inconvenient of these was enabling AHCI link power management (which basically puts the hard disk bus to sleep when there is no IO); Enabling this and then suspending the laptop produced a 5 second delay on resuming because the kernel was forgetting it had put the bus to sleep and so had to wait for it to time out and be reset.
This particular niggle is fixed in 2.6.27 and so my 3-4 second resume times are preserved and I can save power! \o/
After a little while tweaking disk, AHCI, USB, filesystem, wireless, sound and ethernet options I ended up with a system which runs between 8 and 9 Watts when idle, down from 10-14 Watts, which I think is a pretty impressive saving and I'm very curious to find out from other Thinkpad X300 owners how well Windows performs in the power usage stakes - we always hear that Linux is a bit worse, but I'd be really quite surprised if the machine can run with very much less - it's spending (when idle, obviously) 99% of its time in the deepest processor sleep state and is only generating about a hundred interrupts per second (about 70-80% of which are due to my using a 3D desktop and wireless).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Terminator 0.11 released!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2008/09/21/terminator-011-released_20.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-09-21T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2008-09-21:/2008/09/21/terminator-011-released_20.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator" title="Terminator"&gt;Terminator Homepage&lt;/a&gt; to get the goodness that is version 0.11.

It is a fair point. It's not productive or collaborative. It may be true, but ranting about it doesn't help anyone but me.
More productive and collaborative would be to nicely ask these ISVs to establish a less isolated packaging process with our communities and companies (but I don't mean LSB or a new package format). Clearly some people won't work with them on ethical grounds, but a more pragmatic position will accept that commercial software exists, so it might as well not make our lives unnecessarily hard. And the companies shifting Linux are hot on ISVs.

&lt;li&gt;Added keybindings for terms size and scrollbar manipulation. Thanks Emmanuel Bretelle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely revamped config system which now transparently makes use of gconf settings if they are available, falls back to sensible defaults if not, and can be overridden entirely by ~/.config/terminator/config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support terminal zooming - now you can quickly hide all terminals apart from one and either scale the fontsize or not.&lt;/li&gt;

That's not to say that the release will be today or even in the next week - the branch landing may bring us all the infrastructure we need, but it needs some UI and behaviour love to make sure people don't get lost in a maze of nested tabs (although this seems like such a powerful feature for some users that it may well be available as an option). This is the sort of thing I want to avoid out of the box:

One other nice thing we get from chantra's branch is drag&amp;amp;drop re-ordering of terminals. You can kind of see it at work in the screenshot below - we highlight the area of the window where the terminal being dragged will end up (note that you can't see the mouse pointer - it should be over the grey square with a drag icon of a terminal):

First off, in a stunning piece of fail, Lenovo have used a drive from one of the few manufacturers that enforces region coding on DVDs in hardware - Matshita, aka Matsushita, aka Panasonic. This is very frustrating and made worse by the drive shipping in a state with no region code set, so no DVDs at all will play. I now either have the choice of changing it no more than 5 times, or risking the drive with some custom firmware which claims to remove the region code.
Secondly, and more worryingly, there is a new BIOS release for the X300, but one report from a Linux user thus far suggests that the machine has started hard locking. I can't confirm because this machine is far too important to me (ie I use it for work), so I am holding back on the update until I know what's going on.
&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; It occurred to me that it might be useful to document how I changed the region code - install &lt;code&gt;regionset&lt;/code&gt; and run it. It will show you your current region code (0xFF for me, ie region 0) and how many changes you have left, then ask if you want to change it.
&lt;em&gt;Second update&lt;/em&gt; Lenovo actually withdrew the BIOS update, so clearly something was wrong with it. &lt;a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/MIGR-69703.html"&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; lists the models for which they have pushed out a fixed version.

I've been pretty slow lately because of trying to get as many bugs fixed in Hardy as possible.
However, we've still been working away a bit and the team has continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance on gnome is being reduced, and portability is being increased - you can now run Terminator on FreeBSD without a full GNOME install.
Configuration has been entirely replaced - we now offer a stack of config options. If you have gconf available we will look there for gnome terminal settings. If that doesn't work out we'll look for a config file in your home directory and if that fails we have comprehensive default settings.
I'm hoping to push out a release soon because we've also accumulated a few small bugfixes.
The plan from here is to have a major release to land the tabs feature, and then go all out for a massive 1.0 when we can save/restore meta-profiles.

What do you do?! Well, realistically there's not a lot you can do to make it work, but you can do a lot to help get it fixed.
You need to pull off /var/log/syslog, the output of lspci, lspci -v and lspci -vvnn.
You may very well find yourself having a problem with that though, because you're still pretty early in a typical linux boot process, so you probably don't have any disks mounted and you may find yourself missing any modules to make that happen.
You should have usb-storage.ko though. That and isofs.ko.
Can you see where this is going? :)
find the .udeb's on your install CD with a working computer, &lt;code&gt;ar -x&lt;/code&gt; the core fs modules one and pull out ext3 (and jbd and mbcache), or vfat and its dependencies. put them in a directory, then do &lt;code&gt;mkisofs -o /dev/usbstick1 /path/to/modules&lt;/code&gt;.
You now have a partition on your USB stick that is an ISO9660 filesystem (ie a CD). Obviously make sure you don't do this on a USB stick you care about the contents of.
Chuck the USB stick into the broken server, &lt;code&gt;modprobe usb-storage&lt;/code&gt;, mount the newly appeared partition and copy the modules over to the right place in /lib/modules/. Unmount the USB stick, modprobe the drivers and now you can put in an ext3/vfat formatted USB stick and you have somewhere to write the debugging information to!
Easy! :) Now file a bug with the debugging information you collected.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Thinkpad X300 thoughts</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2008/03/17/thinkpad-x300-thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2008-03-17:/2008/03/17/thinkpad-x300-thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Thinkpad X300 is a pretty tasty beast.

What that basically means is that *anything* which occurs after -x on the command line is the command to execute and its arguments, so:
&lt;code&gt;terminator -x screen -U&lt;/code&gt;
should cause terminator to execute &lt;code&gt;screen -U&lt;/code&gt;. By default, most options parsers will see this as the &lt;code&gt;-U&lt;/code&gt; being passed to terminator and &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; being the argument to &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt;.
After looking around the docs and asking on #python, optparse seemed to be a better option than getopts, so I switched it over and implemented a callback to extend the default argument processing for -x. It wasn't quite working, so after another quick foray into #python I ended up reading &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/optparse.html#callback-example-6-variable-arguments"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; which provided everything I needed. More than I needed, in fact, since their while loop has conditionals which affect whether or not the next arguments are added.

The rest I'd just like to keep. For example, I wouldn't cry if I lost all my uni work, but it would be a shame. Same for the working emulation of my trusty Amiga that I used for so long, but now barely remember how to use.
So, not wanting to trust it all to a single hard disk, I bought a second so I can could clone the data onto two disks with RAID1. Not a problem in Linux thanks to software RAID. I knock up a RAID1 with a single partition on the new disk (which the tools like doing as much as they make sandwiches, grr). rsync across the existing / to the raid volume, modify fstab, grub and maybe something else and reboot expecting tenshu to finally live up to its name...
Except that's not its name.
Not when it's booting.
It turns out that having created the RAID volume while fully booted, it had been tagged as being for a machine with a hostname of "tenshu". The initramfs does not know your hostname because your hostname is stored on your root partition, which is a RAID partition that hasn't been mounted yet. It is possible for the initramfs to have a hostname, and I expect it might even have a kernel commandline option to specify it, but either way it's not there by default.
As any string comparison function will tell you, "tenshu" is not an acceptable match for "(none)".
So to fix this, boot the system and it should sit for ages waiting for the RAID arrays to assem ble (this timeout is *far* too long. what the hell takes this long to be detected by the system?!). After a while it will get bored and give you an initramfs shell. Busybox to the rescue!
I suspect you can run &lt;code&gt;mdadm -A /dev/md0 --auto-update-homehost&lt;/code&gt;, although I ran &lt;code&gt;mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sdb3 --update=homehost&lt;/code&gt; to be specific and because I found those options first.

Overall I am most happy with the thing. It's a little bit slow and stranger than SonyEricsson's firmware in some ways, but it has some wicked features:
* GPS
* TV Out
* Symbian
GPS is obviously useful, you can bring up a map of where you are and look around. The TV Out was a total surprise though, and is incredibly cool. I figured it would just be used for things like image galleries, and while they are specifically tailored for TV output, it works everywhere! You can nagivate all the menus, run apps and so on.
Symbian is just really handy because there are plenty of apps for it and a pretty open development environment.
Short review, but all in all, I'm happy so far :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Jorge rocks</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/12/27/jorge-rocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-12-27:/2007/12/27/jorge-rocks.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much to Jorge Castro for &lt;a href="http://stompbox.typepad.com/blog/2007/12/its-not-everyda.html"&gt;pimping&lt;/a&gt; Terminator on his blog.

To get it out of the way quickly, the Pixar shorts disc is great - I've always admired the work of John Lasseter and it's nice to have all the classics in super high quality, all in one place. Disney suck for plastering adverts and trailers all over the disc and stickers all over the box, but whatever.
The PS Eye camera is a nifty bit of hardware - it's a good quality camera with excellent framerate and no boring focusing requirements. The games I've played for it so far (Creature Feature, Trials of Topoq, Aqua Vita and Mesmerize) are either amusing, fun or creative and pretty. Clearly the PS3 has the hardware to do good motion detection in real-time, so it'll be interesting to see what other concepts people can come up with to take advantage of it.
Last, but my absolutely no means least, is Call of Duty 4. I picked up the 3rd installment of this series when I bought the PS3 and I was a little disappointed by it. It was mildly entertaining, but single player games rarely hold my interest for long, plus the engine had obviously been slapped together hastily and some things looked really stupid (eyes and teeth particularly). Plus it's yet another World War 2 game, which we've had quite enough of.
The 4th installment is a totally different beast though - gone are the crappy wooden rifles and anti-German shouting. Instead this is a game based around modern warfare and you alternate between different people (at least an SAS new-recruit and a USMC soldier).
Great weapons, interesting missions (including somewhere you get to be a gunner in aircraft), very pretty graphics and a slick overall presentation.
The online multiplayer is good fun too.
I really really like this game!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Terminator 0.5 released</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/11/09/terminator-05-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-11-09:/2007/11/09/terminator-05-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Terminator 0.5 is out.

When it's in the dock it has a wired connection, otherwise it's just wireless.
Since most of my work involves ssh and I tend to have several long running ssh sessions at a time, it's quite annoying if I quickly undock to go and work in another room and have to reconnect everything.
Of course, this is entirely fixable in Linux (albeit by way of some slightly dodgy hackery). Network Manager is just about quick enough to pick up a new connection before TCP connections time out, and Linux's routing stack is somewhat forgiving about connections switching interface. So, with that in mind, and using a DHCP network - all you need to do to preserve a connection across switching interfaces is have the same IP address on both. Sure you could go and hack at the DHCP config to make sure it serves the same IP to both of your MAC addresses, or you could just have both interfaces share the same MAC. I'm quite sure this breaks all manner of rules, conventions and RFCs, but the point is that it works and it makes my life easier :)
I'll happily take suggestions for a better way to override the MAC address, but this is how I do it:
&lt;code&gt;-(cmsj@waishou)-(~)- cat /etc/modprobe.d/localinstall ipw2200 /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install ipw2200 ; ifconfig eth1 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX&lt;/code&gt;
So in this case I am setting my wireless card's MAC address to that of my wired interface (replace the XX:XX bit with the MAC from your other interface).
This worked fine for me in feisty, but was failing in gutsy and my wireless interface was coming up as eth1_rename. Obviously something new and strange was going on.
It turns out that, in the same way we handle disks by UUID, we now handle network interfaces by MAC address, so udev was getting a little confused.
A quick change of &lt;code&gt;/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules&lt;/code&gt; to stop recognising them by MAC address and start looking at the driver name instead, and it's all fixed. This is how the file looks now:
&lt;code&gt;-(cmsj@waishou)-(~)- cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules# program, probably run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.## You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single line.&lt;/code&gt;
# PCI device 0x8086:0x1077 (e1000)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="e1000", NAME="eth0"
# PCI device 0x8086:0x4220 (ipw2200)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="ipw2200", NAME="eth1"
I'd be wary about doing this on a desktop system where interfaces are more likely to change, but this is a laptop and I am quite certain the e1000 NIC isn't going to move on the PCI bus!
So there you have it :)
&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It's worth noting that sometimes this will confuse some networks (e.g. I recently confused a hotel wired&amp;amp;wifi network into not talking to my laptop anymore and had to change both the wired and wireless MAC address to different addresses)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Skype</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/08/18/skype.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-08-18:/2007/08/18/skype.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Skype has been having network issues in the last few days.

I don't like the fact that I've been using Skype, but I have. Why? Because it's the easiest way to talk to my girlfriend while she's away.
That is, it's easy while it works. It has many downsides, but to be fair to it, it's very good at dealing with firewalls and NAT, something that Ekiga really (really really) isn't.
With Skype broken, and wanting to talk to Ulrike, I suggested we try WengoPhone. She grabbed the windows binary, I grabbed the Linux binary. After a few false starts we got connected and for bonus points, it supports webcams in Windows and Linux, which dramatically improves the value of talking to her (and it's very cool that Ubuntu supports my tiny little Creative laptop webcam out of the box).
To my utter surprise, not only is Wengo GPL'd, it's also really just a SIP client. This is fantastic and it's just a bit of a shame that the interface uses Qt (the Wengo guys say they would love to see a Gtk port. So would I!). I was able to call her Wengo address (translated into the underlying SIP address) from Ekiga, but it took ages to arrange the call, even longer to connect the audio/video to it and even then it got the video wrong.
I know Ekiga has been making great strides in their development version and I very much look forward to being able to use it as a swiss army knife of VoIP. Having said that, I kind of suspect that I will be more tempted by some kind of Telepathy VoIP interface which hides all the tediousness of different forms of instant communication and just lets me type to, talk with, and look at people.
As a result of the Wengo transition, I have just been able to do this:

This is a big release for me, it finally brings in one of the crucial features required to make this more than just a script for 4 terminals in a window - you can now split terminals on demand. Right click on one and you can turn it into two terminals, horizontally or vertically.
My roadmap currently is to have 0.3 allow you to remove terminals. 0.4 will then concentrate on loading/saving some kind of profile so you don't have to do a complex splitting procedure each time you start Terminator. I'm not sure if many other features will get in between 0.4 and 1.0, because there is lots to do on the gconf and gnome-terminal emulation.

However.
What Firefox isn't, is integrated. Sure it renders using gtk (and Cairo, if not already then soon) and gnome actions involving URLs spawn Firefox, but it's still trapped away in its own little universe - Marc Andreeson's gift to the world, a platform agnostic application architecture. Clearly Mozilla has built itself a highly capable cross-platform application architecture, but that necessarily isolates them on every platform.
The trigger behind this post is the patches that recently appeared to let Epiphany use Webkit (Apple's fork of KHTML, as used n Safari). Epiphany isn't a bad browser, but it's not flexible like the fox (purely because there aren't enough extensions). The problem here is that if GNOME is going to achieve the online desktop integration they have been talking about, reliable HTML widgets seem quite vital. GtkMozEmbed (I say having never used it) appears to be very painful to work with.
A high quality GNOME widget based on Webkit that makes displaying HTML really easy would be so extraordinarily useful to the project. It would allow the browser to disappear into the desktop - want to visit a page? click/press something to type some stuff which is an address or search keywords. Out slides the appropriate web page. It gets rid of the necessity to go Applications-&amp;gt;Internet-&amp;gt;Firefox before typing a URL (and yes I know things like deskbar can launch a browser in these circumstances). Mostly it massively lower the barrier to writing apps which partly rely on the internet, or HTML in general, which can only be a good thing for a more online world.
What's holding it back though is Firefox. It's a very popular piece of software, even on Windows. Maybe too popular, if Ubuntu were to drop Firefox by default in favour of an integrated future version of Epiphany it could hurt Ubuntu - one of its selling points is no longer that it uses the much vaunted Firefox thingy people have heard of.
(I also wonder if GTK should support CSS ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Terminator 0.1 released</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/07/28/terminator-01-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-07-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-07-28:/2007/07/28/terminator-01-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just pushed out the first release ever of Terminator, a python script to make a window have multiple Terminals in it.

Immediately prior to jumping into the FOSS world, I was using Windows 98, but I don't really want to talk about that because I never really liked it and it hated my hardware, so it was a very brief partnership.
The 7 or 8 years before that though, were computing heaven because I was a devoted &lt;a href="http://www.amiga.org/"&gt;Amiga&lt;/a&gt; user. Initially I was using an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500"&gt;A500&lt;/a&gt;, which I added a second floppy drive to (I think the Cumana drive I bought cost me about £80!), as well as a couple of MB of Fast RAM (some of which I hacked into being Chip RAM for better graphics). Eventually the 500 was getting far too restrictive and even my 2-disk boot environment was getting hard to live with, so I got a job in a supermarket to earn some money to buy a shiny new &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1200"&gt;A1200&lt;/a&gt;, which was a pretty big leap forward over the 500. After a while I put the much faster 68030 CPU in it (thanks to phase5's excellent &lt;a href="http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=151"&gt;1230 IV&lt;/a&gt; expansion card), a 16MB SIMM and a 120MB 2.5" hard disk. Later I swapped the 030 card for an &lt;a href="http://www.relec.ch/CarteAcc68k.html#Carte%20turbo%20Blizzard%201240T/ERC"&gt;040&lt;/a&gt; card, for even more blazing performance.
Anyway, enough boring hardware reminiscing, on to the fun stuff!
For a while now I've wanted to rescue everything on the last Amiga hard disk I owned (a Western Digital 1.2GB monster!), but since my A1200 had something of a small accident (here's a tip kids, never use the inside of a computer as a footrest) that wasn't going to be hugely easy. Had I not broken the 1200, things would have been fine - by the time I stopped using the Amiga it had an Ethernet interface and a fair whack of UNIX programs on it like scp.
A few months back I fished the disk out of the remains of the Amiga (now forever consigned to the past, as I took the carcass to the local dump), hooked it up to an external USB-IDE interface and took a raw image of the disk. I then bought &lt;a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/"&gt;Amiga Forever&lt;/a&gt;, a distribution of various Amiga Emulators and a pretty much complete set of officially licenced ROMs and system disks (lacking working hardware there was no way I could get dumps of my ROMs or transfer the contents of the PC-incompatible floppy system disks). I briefly dallied with the included emulator for UNIX (the venerable UAE), but it was pretty unstable and on further investigation it turns out that most of the development work these days goes into the Windows fork (WinUAE). This was quite disappointing and I never really looked into it all further.
That was, until last night when I started tidying up all the crap on my desktop and got to the Amiga Forever folder. The pangs of nostalgia grabbed me again and I decided to have another stab at things. This time I used &lt;a href="http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/"&gt;e-UAE&lt;/a&gt;, another fork of UAE, maintained by &lt;a href="http://www.rcdrummond.net/"&gt;Richard Drummond&lt;/a&gt; (any Amiga user will recognise that name). He has been diligently pulling in the improvements from WinUAE, and it really shows. It's much more stable than vanilla UAE (although I can still provoke it into crashing).
This was a good start, but I was still left with the problem of how to extract the data from the disk image I had. After battling with the uae configs a little, I discovered that there was something wrong - I could only persuade the Amiga to see 1 of the 4 partitions. Fortunately it was the one with all my data on - except my old programming stuff, but the point of this exercise was not to rescue data as I had copied the stuff I really cared about off before I stopped using it. The point was to get *my* Amiga running again, even if the hardware was now just some software.
I conversed with some of the long time Amiga stalwarts I still converse with on IRC and one of them pointed me at some &lt;a href="http://www.seebs.net/log/archives/000390.html"&gt;really simple code&lt;/a&gt; to extract partitions from an Amiga disk image. This proved to be part of the key to making everything Just Work™. The other part being that Linux can read &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Fast_File_System"&gt;AFFS&lt;/a&gt; formatted partitions.
I quickly mounted them and pointed e-UAE at the mountpoints and bam! off it went. Ok so I had to spend a few minutes hacking out the various hardware hacks I had from the Startup-sequence, but with that done, I was left with a pretty much exact copy of what I used to use 10 years ago.
It's a very strange experience, leaping back in time like this. You look over your old code, email, pictures and so on and while one part of you thinks "hey I remember this!", another part things "damn what was I thinking" ;)
As &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/"&gt;Jamie Zawinski&lt;/a&gt; found when he tried to do a similar (but unfortunately for him, much more painful) &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/amiga.html"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt; a while back, the best way to keep data from being obsoleted is to keep it on a live computer. Sooner or later all hardware fails, but if you always transfer all of your data from one computer to your new one, you'll never have a huge gap to cross (this is &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; how &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation"&gt;speciation&lt;/a&gt; works, by the way).
Emulation and FOSS suggest that there is no real reason why my Amiga now can't live on forever, virtually. That's hardly the hugest achievement of mankind, but it makes me happy.
I'd like to say thank you to everyone who made the Amiga, everyone who made its community such a fantastic place, and everyone who still works on making it live on.
(As a side note, this all serves to make me think what a natural predecessor to the current Linux ecosystem the Amiga was. It had a powerful shell, a friendly GUI, but most crucially, an active and dedicated community)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>screen titles from ssh</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/13/screen-titles-from-ssh.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-13:/2007/06/13/screen-titles-from-ssh.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I usually have at least 4 terminals visible on my screen at once.

Once you are up to about a dozen or so shells spread across 4 terminals it can get quite interesting to remember where you left the one you are looking for.
Since screen can have a status line which lists its screens, and it is possible to change their names, I figured it ought to be possible to have ssh set the title of a screen when it connects to a remote machine. This would make things a lot easier to find, as well as being a cute hack.
It turns out that it is indeed possible.... to a degree.
ssh lets you specify a command to be run on the local machine after a connection is established, which is the ideal place to do this kind of thing. Sadly it doesn't help you out by setting any useful environment variables (such as the machine you just ssh'd to). You're probably thinking "but you know which one it is, you just ssh'd there!" and while that is true, it's not very easy to handle programatically. Mainly because it means parsing the arguments to ssh, which is no fun at all.
So, rather than do that, I am making the blanket assumption that the final word on ssh's command line is the host you are sshing to. If that is not true (e.g. you are doing "ssh someserver rm /etc/foo") you will get whatever the last word actually is, sucks to be you.
Also, if you use ProxyCommand, you really don't want the second ssh to do this, because it will confuse the first one and you'll never establish a connection, so detecting the type of output ssh is connected to is necessary.
Thanks to the many, many people I've consulted in the process of figuring this out. It doesn't seem like anyone has done this before (at least I can't find an example on google. There are some very similar things though), so after running out of ideas myself I started polling the community and got enough nuggets of inspiration back to produce a workable solution.
You will need to make sure screen is configured to show a status line (otherwise you won't see the screen names, except in a C-A-" or similar). Then drop this into ~/.ssh/config:
&lt;code&gt;PermitLocalCommand yes  LocalCommand tty -s &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cat /proc/$PPID/cmdline | xargs -0 | awk '{ printf ("\033k%s\033\\", $NF) }'&lt;/code&gt;
(yes, that is hacky and disgusting. I am tempted to look at patching ssh to provide the hostname to the spawned LocalCommand shell, but right now the above config seems to be the best way of doing this).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>More PS3 video stuff</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/09/more-ps3-video-stuff.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-09:/2007/06/09/more-ps3-video-stuff.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across a python script called &lt;a href="http://can.homeunix.org/sw/vepp/"&gt;vepp&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to be a simple way of transcoding files for portable media devices.

Specifically, I was doing the partitioning manually, but the two visible disks had no partition tables. Not wanting to trash the PS3 disk I didn't let it create the tables, so had to abort.
After consulting with the very helpful Colin Watson, it turns out that the disk Ubuntu sees as sda is not the whole PS3 disk, it's the Other OS partition virtualised to look like a whole disk. It is therefore fine to create a partition table and proceed with the install, which I will do tonight.
(I'm not sure yet what sdb is, it smells like the PS3s internal flash and again I'm not sure if it's wise to mess with it)
&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; The disks that Linux sees are virtualised by the PS3 (they're actually just partitions made to look like whole disks), so it is fine to make the partition tables (or indeed let the installer do automatic partitioning). &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/106683"&gt;The bug&lt;/a&gt; where the installer hangs at 15% is due to the low RAM in the PS3. Stop some services (cupsys and hplip are good candidates) and remove some things from your session (update-manager and gnome-cups-icon, for example). Removing applets from the panel is not a bad idea either, and don't run anything else while you are installing. Of course you could plug in a disk of some kind and set up swap, but &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/102044"&gt;this bug&lt;/a&gt; makes that quite hard at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>PS3 movie icons</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/05/ps3-movie-icons.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-05:/2007/06/05/ps3-movie-icons.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Games on the PS3 are displayed as a little icon, but it can be animated and some games take advantage of that.

However, the lazyweb rides to the rescue with the news that the PS3 can generate animated thumbnails, but you have to do it yourself. I like that I can do this, but I think it should do it by default and I can choose to override it if I don't like what it auto-captured.
Basically the trick is to pause the video at the point you want the thumbnail animation to start, then hit Triangle and choose "Change Icon". The next 15 seconds of video are rendered to a little thumbnail in not very much time.

I really really didn't want to buy a small TV because they are overpriced (compared to higher resolution monitors) and the thing wouldn't be useful to me when I eventually get a proper TV.
Instead I went with the dirt cheap Dell SE198WFP 19" widescreen monitor. It's an inch smaller than the E207WFP I use for my PC, and consequently only supports slightly smaller resolutions (1440x900 being its maximum). However, it does have some features which make it particularly well suited to the PS3.
&lt;img alt="Dell SE198WFP" src="http://www.tenshu.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/littledell.png"&gt;
First off, it supports HDCP (the DRM system being used in the HDtv world), so I should be able to play back protected content without the PS3 refusing to trust me or downscaling it to an annoyingly low resolution.
900 rows of pixels means the maximum resolution falls somewhere between 720p and 1080i/1080p, however, the monitor supports both. This was especially surprising to me as I had expected to be "limited" to 720p (many/most PS3 games at the moment don't go higher than 720p anyway, and it's still a massive leap over standard definition TV). I need to do some more exhaustive comparisons, but I think I will be going with 720p rather than 1080i (it doesn't seem to support 1080p) because it's an uninterlaced mode, so there is absolutely no flickering. Either way the monitor is scaling the image - the question is, which direction is better? scaling 720 rows up to 900, or scaling 1080 rows down to 900. Time will tell (as will this blog!)
For anyone wondering how I managed to connect a monitor which only has DVI and VGA inputs to the PS3 which only has HDMI, component and composite outputs - fear not, HDMI is actually a combination of DVI signals, audio and probably some other gumpf), so it is entirely possible to convert the HDMI output of the PS3 to DVI. That means no analogue signal/conversion at all, so the picture quality is superb and the cables to do it can be obtained easily and cheaply online (don't splash out on a stupidly expensive gold cable, it's a digital signal so cable quality matters a lot less. Just avoid the inexplicably cheap ones on ebay from the far east, they look very dodgy!).
If you're looking to put a PS3 in a bedroom and don't really care for a TV, I would thoroughly recommend this monitor, especially since you'll still have the VGA port free for other things.
I'm sure you won't care, but it also just happens to fit exactly into the only appropriate place for it on my desk!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>flOw</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/03/flow.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-03:/2007/06/03/flow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic little game ported and improved from an original Flash version.

This happens a few times and then the game starts all over.
It's accompanied by an excellent ambient soundtrack which is largely controlled by what you are doing (very much like the fantastic Rez), and it has a distinctive yet calming visual style.
It's simple, relaxing and fun; It's not very hard and it doesn't take very long to complete. Perfect for under £4 and a few minutes of downloading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Gaming returns</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/03/gaming-returns.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-03:/2007/06/03/gaming-returns.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been missing my PS2 a lot recently.

Sure I have a copy of Windows lying around for when i want to play some games there, but rebooting is much hassle and then I have to fight with Windows. Console games are generally more to my tastes too.
I flirted with a PSP for a while, but I was really dissatisfied with the games available for it (in that they are postly either not my kind of thing, or cut down PS2 games) and so traded it with a friend for a little Linux PDA.
It therefore seemed reasonable to look at the latest round of consoles: Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3. I think it's fair to say that I quite like Sony, so I started out with a heavy bias to the PS3. I've seen the wii in action and I completely understand why it's selling like it was illegal, but it's not really for me so I discounted that idea fairly quickly. Microsoft have done a great job with the 360, I've played about with one quite a bit and it seems like they have gone a long way to solve the various mistakes of the original Xbox. The final option is the PS3, which despite Sony's best managerial efforts, has also turned out to be a pretty stonking machine.
Ultimately the PS3 won out and I'll be posting some vague musings as I explore it (actually I'm writing this a few days after getting it, so I've already got some stuff to fill in).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Motorstorm</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/03/motorstorm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-03:/2007/06/03/motorstorm.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the games I picked up with the PS3 was Motorstorm, which is a dirt racing game with nitrous boosting.

They're probably on the front of your TV under a flap) and a Sony TV to start with.
The initial setup was pretty straight forward, I really like that I get to choose exactly where video and audio are sent - especially since I want my final setup to use the HDMI port to output video and the AV port to output audio. There are too many steps required to do all this setup, especially agreeing to EULAs, but it's all pretty simple and I quickly got the thing connected to my wireless network (builtin wifi is an excellent touch), registered on the Playstation Network and updated to the recently released 1.80 firmware.
I'm not going to touch on games here, just what you can do with the PS3 out of the box once you are setup and registered.
The most obvious thing is play Blu-ray movies, but I don't have any of those and don't especially care about buying stupidly high definition movies for considerably more than I get DVDs for. It's going to be a fair while before I have a decent sized TV to take advantage of it anyway and who knows, maybe HD-DVD will destroy Blu-ray before then. It plays DVDs fine too of course, and it does so fairly well. A nice touch is that it remembers where you were in a movie if you quit the player, letting you do something else and come back exactly where you were.
It plays Audio CDs too (and probably DVD audio discs, but I don't even know anyone who owns such a thing, let along have them myself), and can rip tracks from them onto the internal hard disk. You get a choice of various formats all of which were irrelevant apart from the de-facto mp3. The importing is pretty quick, but can't be done in the background. It can look up the artist/album/track information about the CD on the Internet, but it doesn't seem to download a picture of the disc (or at least it didn't for the Hybrid album I tested it with).
There's a vaguely useful web browser which at least has enough Flash™ support to work with YouTube. I have my laptop next to me, so I haven't tested the browser very thoroughly at all. I imagine it's significantly better with a USB keyboard and mouse (which are supported in most of the PS3, from what I can see).
Unusual things lurk about, like Folding@Home. It's not listed as a game (which it isn't), so it shows up in a fairly unusual place. I guess it's nice that people can contribute to health research by leaving their consoles on overnight, but it's not very interesting to me and seems somewhat wasteful and likely to shorten the PS3s useful life.
The Playstation Store lets you download full games, game demos, and videos. It doesn't have a particularly great interface at the moment and there's not a very wide selection of content, but this side of the next-gen consoles is very important - being able to download content either for free or for money makes trying and buying games easier, but also makes it practical to release small games. I have bought flOw and Tekken 5:DR for about £10. Neither would make sense on shop shelves at regular PS3 game prices, they're too small/simple to justify it, but for a few quid each and a short download, everybody wins. I hope this trend explodes into a vibrant marketplace and community, and gets some UI love from Sony!
As well as those two games, I grabbed a bunch of demos and some very pretty HD movie trailers. All very nice and shows much potential for the future.
Printers and digital cameras are supported somehow, but I lack the equipment and inclination (respectively) to test them.
Throughout the media related sections of the PS3 it offers a tantalising "Search for media servers" option. This probably refers to some Sony thing you can buy, but I discovered online that the PS3 supports UPnP (a way for media devices on a network to announce themselves). A quick setup of MediaTomb on my Ubuntu Feisty desktop (which holds all my music/media) and I could browse all of my media through the PS3. Note that I said browse and not play. It plays my mp3s fine, but it can only play MPEG1, MPEG2 and H.264 movies (plus some basic MPEG-4 that isn't H.264). It doesn't play divx, xvid, Real or Quicktime. Still, the formats it does play are available and easily converted to, so I can make some things playable on the PS3 (usually with a recent SVN version of ffmpeg).
I don't really think the UI for browsing media scales well to the amount of media I have on my computer, but would be fine for stuff copied onto the PS3 itself. I hope this changes over time as digital media density continues to increase.
The menu system you get when you turn the PS3 on is called XMB (Cross Media Bar) and is basically the same as the one on the PSP, but it lacks some features at the moment (RSS/Podcast and Themes, most obviously). Some other bits from the PSP are also missing which make much less sense, such as network connection profiles. I will quite likely take my PS3 to other peoples' houses, so it's a pain to have to re-enter all the wifi details every time (or even if I just want to quickly move it to the wired network to copy a big file). Lots of things you can do from the XMB can't be done as background tasks (ripping CDs as mentioned previously, which really has to change. It's not like the PS3 isn't powerful enough to rip a CD, download files, install a downloaded game and browse the web at the same time. Network updates make this all entirely fixable, but who knows what Sony will choose to do.
The settings menus are comprehensive and useful, but fairly boring. There are CompactFlash, SecureDigital/MMC and MemoryStick interfaces, plus 4 USB ports. Media from any of these can be played (if you organise them correctly). Another nice touch is Bluetooth, which can at least be used for in-game voice chat via a headset (which come with many phones these days, so you may already have one).
Adding "friends" to the Playstation Network stuff is pretty basic and the games don't all seem to hook into it, which is a shame. This is something Microsoft have been doing better since the original Xbox and Sony should really have worked harder here, but they don't want to run a big, centralised server operation like Microsoft does with Xbox Live (which also means you don't have a pay a subscription, like you do with Xbox Live).
Local users can be added too, presumably to separate media out between members of the family. It's my PS3, and mine alone, so I don't care about this either. If you want to put media on a PS3, get your own! ;)
I think that about covers all the stuff you can do at the moment that isn't playing a game. It's a pretty impressive list of stuff too and has so much potential for more. It also looks nice, and changes colour slightly during the day.
As a side note, the unit itself is huge, heavy and hot. It does look nice though.
I'm happy so far :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tekken 5: Dark Revolution</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2007/06/03/tekken-5-dark-revolution.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2007-06-03:/2007/06/03/tekken-5-dark-revolution.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a PSP game which has been ported to the PS3 and had its graphics restored to the original arcade levels.

There are a couple of slightly different fight modes, but nowhere near what it should be to be considered a full and complete game.
It's a small download for about 6 quid and it's fast, Tekken fun. I can't argue with that. That is until Soul Caliber comes out in a few months.

So I know how to, should i want to for any reason, this is how you can make videos that are playable on a PS3 (only tested on firmware 1.80). Note that it doesn't transcode to H.264, but instead uses a lesser MPEG4 profile of some kind (mpeg4 appears to be entirely too complicated to figure out!).
This mostly comes from &lt;a href="http://po-ru.com/diary/bleeding-edge-ffmpeg-on-ubuntu-feisty/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the gist is that you grab a specific version of ffmpeg from SVN and compile it against a variety of media libraries from multiverse. This makes me think ubuntu should have a bleeding edge version of ffmpeg in multiverse that links against the libraries there - if licences allow for it.
For what it's worth, this is the command line I've been using with it (note that it will strip surround audio down to 2 channel stereo. That's all i have, so I haven't bothered to figure out anything better).

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;koudelkat&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;lilyj:&lt;/span&gt; I hope we can include frogging in the agenda, I&amp;#39;ve been bad.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;cdavies&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to frog you, if only you&amp;#39;d toad the line.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;koudelkat&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;lilyj:&lt;/span&gt; Meat you in the morning, then.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;Ng&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;cdavies:&lt;/span&gt; he always weasels his way out of such things
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;cdavies&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Ng:&lt;/span&gt; Oh, I didn&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;m newt to this.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;cdavies:&lt;/span&gt; that&amp;#39; stoat-ally untrue
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;koudelkat&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;we just spent an hour on delicious puns
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;koudelkat&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;i didn&amp;#39;t even notice
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;it was our dogged determination that got us through
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;cdavies&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;that and years of squirrelling away puns.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;But we were finally able to come out of our shells
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;fur what it&amp;#39;s worth
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;cdavies&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;and that the audience didn&amp;#39;t let fruit fly.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;Ng&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#39;m impressed, I thought it&amp;#39;d die out quickly, but you all kept beavering away
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;cdavies:&lt;/span&gt; They&amp;#39;re just gnat like that
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;of course, sometimes they can bee waspish
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;koudelkat&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;I canter do this anymore. :(
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;koudelkat:&lt;/span&gt; no need to get your gallop

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;Ng&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;and your salvation shall be found virus
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;cdavies&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;you shouldn&amp;#39;t ape jesus.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;Ng&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;cdavies:&lt;/span&gt; he won&amp;#39;t be back until the raptor ;)
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;kif&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;woah, this has been going on for ages
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;Ng&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;kif:&lt;/span&gt; I&amp;#39;ll bison time while you catch up ;)

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;cdavies&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;and that gets my goat.
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;    &amp;lt;lilyj&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;besides, it probably won&amp;#39;t beetle tomorrow sometime that we decide to stop

I appreciate that lots of people don't want information as densely packed as I do, but that's clearly not going to stop me trying. Up until now it's not been enough of an issue to do anything about, because I've had at least one big monitor for quite some time now.
However, since I recently got a very portable laptop which only does 1024x768, my mind has been mulling over ways to save as much screen space as possible.
With that in mind, I've collapsed down as much stuff as I can and present two screenshots, firstly of &lt;a href="http://www.pointlessrubbish.net/waishou-2006-12-06-firefox.png"&gt;my firefox workspace&lt;/a&gt; and secondly of &lt;a href="http://www.pointlessrubbish.net/waishou-2006-12-06-thunderbird.png"&gt;my thunderbird one&lt;/a&gt;. All the gnome stuff I care about is packed into one little toolbar at the top and since I always run these apps with the windows maximised, I use devilspie to strip the window borders. My main workspace just has four terminals at the maximum sizes they can be (which works out at about 82x29 with small fonts).
Finally, as a challenge, can anyone suggest ways to save even more screen space?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>A year on</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2006/11/26/year-on.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2006-11-26:/2006/11/26/year-on.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to say that, a year since I moved to London, things are seriously rocking.

I picked up a ThinkPad x40 recently to use with Dapper and I thought I'd chuck up a few notes from my experience thus far. I deliberately chose the ThinkPad because of the reputation of IBM's laptops and especially that they use very good hardware and it has to be said that on a modern distro, especially one that aims to work well with laptops, almost every bit of hardware works straight away after install. I would seriously recommend &lt;a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/"&gt;ThinkWiki&lt;/a&gt; to anyone attempting ThinkPad/Linux shenanigans - they have a huge amount of information about the various bits of hardware, installation guides, tips and a bunch more, all nicely tagged so you can tell which bits are relevant to the machine you own.
First off I'll run through some of the key steps of installation.
1. Before doing anything else, I used the IBM tools in the pre-installed Windows XP to produce restore images and burn them to disc (one CD, one DVD). This is mostly a precaution in case I either have some insurmountable problem with Linux on the machine, or if I ever come to sell it and the buyer wants their licenced copy of Windows.
2. After that I did a pretty much default install of Ubuntu. If you want to, you can set the BIOS to disable protection for the "hidden" IBM recovery partition, then use the whole disk in the Ubuntu installer. I chose to leave it there, but I may reclaim it at some point in the future. I read on a few pages/forums that suspending seems to be more reliable if you add &lt;code&gt;acpi_sleep=s3_bios&lt;/code&gt; to the kernel command line, which is easy to do in Ubuntu. Edit &lt;code&gt;/boot/grub/menu.lst&lt;/code&gt; (you can use &lt;code&gt;gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst&lt;/code&gt; if you don't know otherwise) and place the above acpi_sleep option on the end of the &lt;code&gt;kopt=&lt;/code&gt; line and running &lt;code&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/code&gt;.
3. With the install done I set about installing a few bits and pieces to make the laptop more useful - things like Network Manager (so it's trivially easy to join wired/wireless networks from the desktop), various Bluetooth tools (install &lt;code&gt;gnome-bluetooth&lt;/code&gt; and you get most of the bits you need), Java (&lt;code&gt;sun-java5-plugin&lt;/code&gt;), mplayer, a few other multimedia libraries including Real Player (available, along with Opera, in the Add/Remove tool (see the Applications menu) if you enable the commercial repository).
4. Start testing things - graphics work fine, wireless works fine with the madwifi driver (although there is some possibility that there is a kernel crashing bug in the version Dapper offers, see LaunchPad &lt;a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15/+bug/37773"&gt;bug 37773&lt;/a&gt;), wired ethernet is great, keyboard keys mostly seem to work (volume controls work by default, which is a nice touch).
5. Configure it. The first thing I did was disable the Sound Server Daemon in Gnome (called Esound, or &lt;code&gt;esd&lt;/code&gt;) because I really dislike it. I then stripped out all the interfaces from &lt;code&gt;/etc/network/interfaces&lt;/code&gt; other than &lt;code&gt;lo&lt;/code&gt; so that Network Manager will take responsibility.
6. Tweak things. Mplayer always works better if you add an entry to &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysctl.conf&lt;/code&gt; that says &lt;code&gt;dev/rtc/max-user-freq=1024&lt;/code&gt; and the ThinkPad's wireless activity LED can be enabled with &lt;code&gt;dev/ath0/softled=1&lt;/code&gt;. I fiddled with the settings in the Power Management options in Preferences, but these are personal choices, so I won't bother listing them. One thing I would recommend is setting it to only show an icon when it is charging or discharging - if you're on AC and the battery is full you don't really need an icon, so you get a few extra pixels of panel space (and because the screen is small I'd recommend ditching the lower panel and moving its applets to the top). On the subject of applets and screen estate, you can replace the "Applications Places System" menus with a single "Main Menu" applet, which shows an ubuntu logo on the panel - click on it and you get the Applications menu, with Places and System tacked onto it. Gnome's sensors applet can read the information provided by the &lt;code&gt;ibm-acpi&lt;/code&gt; driver, so you can monitor the temperature of various bits of hardware and fan speeds. Also of some interest is the CPU Frequency Scaling applet (which shows you how much Linux is throttling your CPU when its idle). One final Gnome panel tip is that if you make it 25 pixels tall instead of the default 24, larger windows will get their window manager icons shown in the Workspace switcher applet. A trivial little detail, but it's kinda handy if (like me) you tend to run things fullscreen on their own workspace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Yudee!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2006/04/08/yudee.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-04-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T21:02:24+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2006-04-08:/2006/04/08/yudee.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years older, a couple of years wiser, I saw &lt;a href="http://www.uglyduckling.us/"&gt;Ugly Duckling&lt;/a&gt; again at the Jazz Cafe in cheery old Camden Town recently.

The venue is kinda small so it's *very* cosy, but the only people at UD gigs seem to be all other UD fans, so everyone is having a shitload of fun and is ignoring the inevitable game of "guess the body part" ;)
From a weird, observational point of view, the typical demographic this time was older and more suburban than last time, which is...as I said, weird.

No problem I thought, that will be the password I set for the master thingy in firefox. Wrong was I.
A little googling turns up that you should copy the key3.db file too, which is fair enough, but I really think this kind of thing should be easier. That does have a nasty habit of tending to introduce a lot of complexity as more aspects of the program get more flexible, especially from the user's point of view. Interface designers are getting pretty good at making simple interfaces that do the right thing most of the time, with more advanced options hidden away for when they are needed and this is something I like a lot, but it's a shame that all that functionality is isolated with the user.
It makes me pine for the old days of ARexx on the Amiga. It was (fortunately) considered de rigeur for self-respecting applications to support it and it exposed the full user functionality of a program to automatic scripting. If that kind of thing were updated for the modern world and combined with bindings for the various scripting languages, a whole range of possibilities open up. Back in the Amiga days, Arexx was all about automating the hell out of graphical tasks for power users, but I have been thinking about another possible use.
The idea would be an alternative to traditional help systems which are tedious to compile, large to download, not always very helpful, etc. Instead, exploiting an Arexx-like ability to control applications, the "help" system guides users through the application without making them watch a stupid tutorial - it actually helps them.
That is to say, I click "help me export my data", it asks me some simple and sensible questions to figure out what to do, and actually opens the right windows and shows me what to do while it does it. In one feature you are training the user to do it for themselves (maybe they want to do it or they want to use more advanced options), and you are providing a simple, automated solution for the casual/new user who maybe uses this feature once a year at most and doesn't need to learn it. This has to beat writing reams of documentation and capturing thousands of screenshots. You just need a few text prompts to explain what is happening and what the results are, and the rest is scripting that is quite stable. The developers can do whatever they like inside their application, the "help" is controlling it at the level of UI widgets, effectively. It might even be possible to write the scripts and place the text prompts with some kind of tool, rather than write them by hand.
Perhaps it could be done by the UI designers in Glade-like applications - the same functionality could be useful to them for automated testing and they could write the tests, documentation and interface with the same tool into one XML interface file.
Does that make any kind of sense?
Randomly, I also think the next release of Ubuntu should have a little animated Jeff Waugh who pops up and talks to new users, cheers them up and helps them learn how to use Ubuntu Linux, preferably with the above help system ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ancestor’s Tale</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2005/09/28/ancestors-tale.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-09-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2005-09-28:/2005/09/28/ancestors-tale.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I was on holiday recently I went on a bit of a reading marathon, which included The Ancestor's Tale, by Richard Dawkins.

I just can't recommend this book enough - unless you are a wizened old Biology professor you aren't going to know all of the cool and fascinating things in this book, but you should! Especially in these times of madness where Intelligent Design creeps insidiously through the minds of many.
It is literally dripping with footnotes and references to Dawkins's other works and those of other authors (including, obviously, The Origin of Species).
The book starts out in the present day and traces back through time, examining each of the points where major groups of species join into our ancestry. This is an entirely arbitrary way to look at it, but avoiding going forward in time removes any problems with language suggesting that there is intent or purpose in Evolution; And it is more convenient to consider us as the main line because we are humans, but the early chapters make it abundantly clear that the structure is humanocentric because it has a human author and that there can be no suggestion that Evolution was leading towards us.
One of the most fabulous concepts in the book is actually quite generalised and applies to many areas outside Evolution; It relates to how we view things as discrete objects/groups and dislike gradiated scales (e.g. we like to label people black or white when in reality there is a full range of skin tones and a "black" person can have lighter skin than a "white" person). Dawkins refers to this as The Tyrrany of The Discontinuous Mind and I think it's a very interesting way of looking at things.
Sadly this book is not for the faint-hearted, it's a pretty weighty tome and isn't shy about using Biological terminology (almost always with an excellent explanation though).

It has a pretty clever idea and some snappy dialogue, but it also has a lot of meaningless rambling and a very strange central message - other reviewers have suggested this is the influence of Madonna's crazy Kabbalah beliefs, which sounds entirely plausible to me.

It's not perfect, but it many of the weaknessesof the t610 are gone or minimised, and new features have been added and integrated extremely well.
Visually the phone is quite simple, I have a mostly black one and half of the front is flat clear plastic for the screen, the rest is buttons, which are bigger than those on the t610, but seem like they are quite flimsy and may be easily encouraged to fall off. Time will have to tell on that.
The phone has plenty of hardware, too much really. There's a much more detailed display than on the t610, mp3 playback, fm radio, movie playback, movie recording, flash, autofocus... it's all a bit much really. I already have two digital cameras for different occasions, I don't really need a 2 MegaPixel camera in my phone; I do realise that these are "useful" to a lot of people though ;) The shortcut button between the two soft buttons is very nice, being able to quickly pull up the functions you most use can save a lot of menu diving. The thing has a MemoryStick Duo slot too, which is a genius plan really. If you don't already have a little digital camera to keep in your pocket and a little mp3 player to keep in your other pocket, this phone can realistically do the job of both, and save you having a third pocket used by your phone. The Duo cards are pretty cheap and I have seen suggestion that it can support up to 2GB (mine shipped with a 64MB card pre-installed, in addition to the 30-somethingMB onboard). It also seems to have some kind of 3D graphics ability - my Orange branded unit shipped with a Sega tennis game that is in 3D and Alex's one on O2 came with a 3D flight sim of some kind (I don't mean crazy red and green specs, it is rendering a 3D engine ;)
The biggest improvement over the t610 and probably the best thing about this phone is the software. It's clearly based at least in concept on that of the t610 (which in turn in herits from the t68 and earlier), but it's much, much faster. Speed has often been a problem for SonyEricsson, text message inputs regularly lag a long way behind even a moderate typer. I was often several menus ahead of mine in general use, which is a serious pain. No more, menus appear much quicker and are able to use the higher screen resolution to display more information, reducing the number of questions you have to answer to perform even the simple task of calling someone. The phonebook is wonderful now; if you start typing it jumps to the letters you press instead of waiting a second; instead of selecting a person and then getting a request to select the number, it now displays the default number and offers a direct call option, then offers horizontal scrolling to select alternate numbers/addresses. Very handy. Also nice is the text message recipient chooser keeping a list of recent contacts.
The browser seems to work well, the menus/notices are often animated and pretty, you can have an animated background if you really want. The media player is quite an interesting idea, I am investigating transcoding movies and putting them on memory stick - it'll be interesting to see how the battery stands up to such tests.
The supplied USB cable charges the phone; &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; handy and it also presents the MemoryStick to the host computer as a USB storage device, so it will work with pretty much anything that works with USB memory sticks. It's bloody fantastic to see mobile phone and camera companies adopting this more and more instead of proprietary communication protocols. It makes integration far easier for Operating Systems, as shown by the fact that I connect the phone to my PC running Ubuntu Hoary and it is able to mount the storage drive and notice there is digital camera data there, and offering to import the photos into my albums. Simple things like that make these devices much more rewarding in my opinion (and I'm pretty sure I'm right ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Glastonbury 2005</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2005/06/29/glastonbury-2005.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-06-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2005-06-29:/2005/06/29/glastonbury-2005.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Woo!

However, it's closed source and quite expensive, which is a bit of a downside, but at the same time it should give me some leverage to get the features I want into future versions, right? Probably not.
I've been bugging the Zend support guys about AMD64 support for near enough 10 months now, with little success. Now, this might not seem too surprising, what with it being closed source, but the important difference here is that Zend's Studio is written in &lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;.
Given that Java is supposed to be a platform agnostic virtual machine, precisely why is it that Zend only ship binaries for a few platforms? The answer appears to be that the installer they use to install said binaries on customer machines is a complete nightmare.
Specifically they appear to be using InstallAnywhere, which is becoming quite common for installing java programs, especially on Linux. Sadly it has some pretty serious flaws. Firstly it's one of those godawful self-extracting/installing shell scripts, so modifying the installer is exceptionally hard. It also knows almost nothing about AMD64, despite the fact that it ought to be really quite compatible with 32bit code (especially for something as library-free as java) and triggers a lovely glibc bug (set "&lt;code&gt;LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5&lt;/code&gt;" on an AMD64 machine and then try to run anything ;)
So basically that all sucks and anyone using InstallAnywhere is cutting themselves off from potential customers for no particularly good reasons. Obviously I can't accept that, so knowing that Zend Studio is really just a Java program I went at it with a copy of vim and a lot of scribbling notes until I figured out how InstallAnywhere's crazy LAX configuration system worked. With that out of the way I was able to determine that all you need to do to make this thing run *perfectly* on AMD64 is make two tiny changes to two not-so-tiny text files. Simple!
Here's how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Zend Studio somewhere (a 32bit machine or a 32bit chroot), copy the folder to your 64bit install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look in the directory Studio is installed in (e.g. "&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/Zend/ZendStudioClient-4.0.2/&lt;/code&gt;") and edit "&lt;code&gt;bin/ZDE.lax&lt;/code&gt;", you need to have "&lt;code&gt;lax.nl.current.vm&lt;/code&gt;" point to your 64bit Java VM binary (e.g. "&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/java&lt;/code&gt;").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now edit "&lt;code&gt;bin/ZDE&lt;/code&gt;" and comment out the line "&lt;code&gt;export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5&lt;/code&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it, fire up &lt;code&gt;bin/ZDE&lt;/code&gt; and you should be hacking PHP in 64bits of goodness (be aware you may need to reconfigure where Zend Studio finds external binaries like cvs - see the ZDE configuration window).
&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;
I've spoken with Zend since writing this and although they are still not committing to supporting AMD64, they did provide me with a handy link to download the Zend Studio installer without the 32bit JVM in it, which (with some work) makes a native 64bit install possible. Hurrah!
So, what to do, well firstly you will need the tarball (I'm not going to link to it, ask Zend) and to extract it. This should leave you with a single file called &lt;code&gt;ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin&lt;/code&gt; (in the case of 4.0.2, current release at the time of writing). Run the command:
&lt;code&gt;cat ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin | sed -e 's/=2.2.5/=a.a.a/g' &amp;gt;ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin.1&lt;/code&gt;
Then run "&lt;code&gt;sh ./ZendStudio-4_0_2.bin.1&lt;/code&gt;" and the installer should start. Once it has completed you still won't actually be able to start ZDE because the same LD_ASSUME nonsense is going on there, so edit "bin/ZDE". Above I showed the quick and hacky way to make this work - comment out the "&lt;code&gt;LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5&lt;/code&gt;" - however there is a way that is probably better, so I will encourage you to do this instead... Edit line 1326 so instead of reading simply:
&lt;code&gt;if [ `uname` = "Linux" ]; then&lt;/code&gt;
it now reads:
&lt;code&gt;if [ `uname` = "Linux" -a `uname -m` != "x86_64" ]; then&lt;/code&gt;
and all will be well :o)
&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;
One thing I hadn't noticed because it was working transparently is that not all of ZDE is Java, for example the code analyzer binary in Zend's bin/ folder appears to be a native 32bit binary. These should still work fine if you have some 32bit compatibility libraries installed (Fedora should install these by default on AMD64, Debian based systems may need to install the ia32-libs package).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Walkies!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2005/05/05/walkies.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-05-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2005-05-05:/2005/05/05/walkies.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I went up to Edale in Derbyshire with Simon, Tam, Marky and Tom.

Format is a great DJ and Abdominal is a great rapper. D-Sisive was ok, but doesn't seem to be as good as Abdominal.
They played some tunes off their new album, "If you can't join em, beat em" as well as some classics from "Music for the Mature B-Boy", including a very funny version of Vicious Battle Raps with most of the lyrics reversed from the original.
There was a bunch of crowd interaction, including getting a guy to race against Abdominal; he had to eat a breadstick and then whistle in the same amount of time it took Abdominal to rap out 8 bars at full speed (which isn't very many seconds). Personally I think he lost, but they gave him the CD anyway ;)

With that out of the way, I think GT4 is a fantastic game. To be fair though it is only really the culmination of what GT3 could have been and isn't a huge leap forward. That is ok though, GT3 was released 4 years ago and probably took a couple of years at least to write, so a lot will have been learned since then about exploiting the PS2 to the fullest. The addition of a huge library of cars and a good number of tracks only improves the experience. Disappointingly absent is online play, instead we get LAN play and a particularly silly photo mode.
Very few games have equalled even the performance of GT3, but GT4 goes better in looks, sounds and feel and will certainly be tough to beat.
I happen to have a Logitech GT Force wheel, which was the official GT3 wheel and it makes any racing game many times more fun than with a controller, but the Gran Turismo games get a particular boost because they are so technical. Snow and rally tracks are something of a challenge to whip the wheel round for opposite lock, but that tradeoff buys you exceptional control for drifting round the corners and seems to be well worth it. I just got a gold on the IA license snow track after getting a bronze first time and then two silvers, so the wheel must definitely be helping because I'm not normally that good ;)
Therefore, if you are looking for a really good, but quite serious driving game, look no further. If you enjoyed GT3 a lot, this would be a good time to refresh the memory with a slightly new twist :)
In addendum, it is said that engineering samples of the PS3 have been produced, so let's hope that one is on its way to Polyphony Digital so they can blow us away with a stunning evolution in the GT series to launch with the PS3 (including full and amazing online support damnit!)

I've only watched a few of the extra bits, the ones I thought would be most interesting/funny and they were (the stuff about weta digital and post production was great) and I probably won't bother with the rest, it's just nice to have finally closed out the full, extended trilogy at last. I can still remember seeing Fellowship of The Ring quite clearly a few years ago and I've really enjoyed watching it develop since then.
I went for the boxed version, which includes a little model of Minas Tirith, which is very funky and goes with the Argonath from the Fellowship boxed version nicely :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/12/12/half-life-2-deathmatch.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-12-12:/2004/12/12/half-life-2-deathmatch.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blimey.

Of course, the original is now too old to make any proper bank, so it's time to take a good idea and apply a thick layer of shiny mediocrity and remake it; and so they have, with Jude Law as a modern Alfie.
Law has the charm to pull off the kind of character Alfie is supposed to be, but I felt the film generally was quite hollow. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it didn't feel like it offered very much in the latter stages of the film - Alfie is learning the errors of his ways, but I just didn't care very much.
Also, the wardrobe people need firing, Alfie didn't have a single suit that was actually big enough for him.

The last GTA game, Vice City, was itself a dramatic improvement on the preceeding titles and Rockstar have continued the evolution of their beautiful engine with a variety of changes and new features that make the game more engaging and sustainable.
Prime examples of this are the attributes of your character, CJ. As you undertake activities your skill at them improves (so shooting more people improves your aim and opens new combat style movements for gun battles, running more improves your stamina). Overall this seems to make the game far more engaging, although attributes such as hunger are more annoying and it seems to be possible to starve your character to death if you don't buy it a burger every so often.
The map is *huge* and in the same way that Vice City was blatantly Miami, this is blatantly LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas, the Sierra Nevada desert and some of the coastal stuff, plus a bunch of bits that didn't look obviously like anything I know of. Only one corner of the map is unlocked to begin with, but thanks to some sneakiness at the airport we managed to steal a jet and fly over the rest of the map (getting shot down by the Air Force in the process ;) and it is simply stunning. The Vegas stuff looks particularly good, I expect the missions there will be interesting; San Francisco also looked cool although I kept crashing before I could figure out if Alcatraz is there.
As much fun as the missions are, I still like the odd one-man-army style rampage, so it is most helpful that the weapons cheats are the same as in Vice City. The new and vastly improved aiming/targetting system makes taking on multiple characters much easier than before, but when you start gaining weapons skills the speed and accuracy of your character is amazing, he can fell crowds in seconds. A good way to attract the police, but also a good way of taking them out too.
Being able to recruit gang members is cool, although they have an annoying habit of shooting at other gangs at every available opportunity. Getting shot at by rival gangs all over the place is not cool, but it makes it more interesting I suppose ;)
So, if you liked the previous GTA games, I strongly suggest you take a look at San Andreas, it seems like it is the best of the bunch. If you've never played a GTA game and you can safely detach virtual violence from the real thing, pick up a controller and get shooting/stealing/racing/kidnapping/etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Team America</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/10/26/team-america.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-10-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-10-26:/2004/10/26/team-america.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok ok, so I slightly downloaded a copy of Team America: World Police.

It is extremely childish and stupid, but it was also hilarious. I can see a lot of people aren't going to like it though and quite a few will probably be offended by it.
The puppets have amazing heads, they're really astonishingly good. The bodies are shit, but it looks like they did that deliberately to make the puppets fight/run really stupidly.
Their charaterisation of Kim Jong Il is absolutely fantastic and I found myself laughing at almost everything he said; Some of the Team America characters were quite annoying though, so it wasn't perfect by any means.
As my flatmate pointed out, they didn't do enough work on the satire really.

It feels mostly like Debian, which is what I was running before I moved to Fedora (for the better 32/64bit compatibility), but has a little more pace to it so far, plus a pretty significant surge of good will and interest.
One thing I am a little disappointed in is that it seems the releases (in this case their first; warty) won't change much beyond security and important bug fixes. They are scheduled for every 6 months though. Personally I still think a rolling-stable approach to the desktop is going to be a killer feature if it happens.
What will set Ubuntu's real course now they have a userbase will be the development of the next release, hoary. There are now quite a lot of people who are want to get involved and want to help. We just have to hope the process shapes itself well and a coherant way of working emerges and works well.
My favorite things about it are really all things about GNOME, especially the automatic digital camera importing. It's fantastic to see the computer become more aware of what is happening to it and behave Correct™ly.
My least favorite is really inherited from Debian - the 32bit compatibility on AMD64 machines isn't great. The good thing is that I can confidently append "yet" to that :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Hellboy: Directors Cut</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/10/18/hellboy-directors-cut.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-10-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-10-18:/2004/10/18/hellboy-directors-cut.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hellboy is another release in the recent spate of comic inspired movies riding the dollar wave of Spiderman and X-Men.

Unlike some of them, it's actually a pretty good film.
It's pretty standard stuff in terms of a comic action movie, but the performances set the film apart from its peers. Ron Perlman is very amusing as the stone-fisted Ted Danson lookalike "Hellboy", John Hurt is convincing as the doddery Professor (classic comic stuff, a father-like figure who provides moral guidance and then dies somehow) and Karl Roden is sinister as Rasputin.
The effects are quite nicely done - some of the transitions from real people to CGI people are a bit obvious, but these things are still remarkably hard to do right when you are looking at them at DVD or higher resolution (case in point, Matrix Reloaded's effects looked seamless at the cinema, a bit noticeable on DVD and they are just plain obvious on the HDTV version - there's simply so much detail that no computer algorithms currently available can trick your brain into believing it is reality). I guess the sound was ok, but none of the soundtrack sticks in my mind, so it can't have been great ;)

&lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; Linux is a fork of Debian's unstable branch, sid. It includes newer GNOME packages than sid (although they are due very shortly I believe) and appears to have a much more pragmatic approach to distro making. Bad for servers, good for getting a distro that has no release as such, but is just tracking the current stable releases of as much software as possible.
And therein lies the key, making a lot of software available - something that Debian has an incredible history of, with many thousands of packages. Where Debian is limited by being out of date and stable or slightly behind the times and unstable, Ubuntu will hopefully offer more stability and predictability than sid, but still a current desktop (probably where the approach is best suited, since that is where development is happening quickest).
To get lots of software, the Ubuntu guys have been &lt;a href="http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~mako/ubuntu-traffic/u20040924_05.html#4"&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; about two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow easy importing of packages from sid that compile (which we can reasonably assume to be most of the interesting packages people are going to want)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow easy importing of user contributed packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second item is the real key I think. If it is incredibly easy to submit a source package, have it be autobuilt on all architectures and when that works, reviewed by a project member for inclusion, people will do it. We see on distros like Fedora that people are prepared to put in massive efforts to maintain current software (see, the &lt;a href="http://dag.wieers.com/"&gt;Dag&lt;/a&gt; and other RPM repositories. Their efforts are significantly hampered by the fact that they are unable to integrate their packages into the main Fedora trees, leading to them having to replace Fedora packages with newer versions and other worrying things. A big problem is that the various trees are not necessarily entirely compatible and there is some overlap. On a personal note, I find that having all of the sites that support x86_64 in yum's config makes it incredibly slow (I'd use apt, but it doesn't support Fedora's excellent biarch system).
If this goes well, I would propose formalising the system to a degree by using &lt;a href="http://www.gnupg.org/"&gt;GPG&lt;/a&gt; to allow the maintainer of a package to upload new versions without requiring moderator time. This is obviously another tactic lifted largely from debian, although they require manual verification by a debian developer who are the only ones with keys capable of uploading a new package.
I will be watching Ubuntu closely, and if they do move in the direction I am hoping, it will have to be worth a shot :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>The city, locked down</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/09/24/city-locked-down.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-09-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-09-24:/2004/09/24/city-locked-down.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I work immediately off the seafront in Brighton, pretty much round the corner from the famous Grand Hotel, and the not so famous Brighton Centre.

We are one of the three party political conference cities, so each year we have one of the three main political parties roll into town. Since I've worked in the same place for a little over 4 years now I've seen a complete rotation and it is quite fascinating how they vary.
This year we are "blessed" with Labour, the ruling party. What this means is that security is tighter than for the other two. The Tories have minimal security and the Police send a community liason officer for the Lib Dems ;-)
Since we live in a changed world, where anyone can be a walking timebomb, fear is the order of the day, because those timebombs can strike anywhere. I am not sure where this stops being a reasonable argument and becomes self perpetuating madness, but there is a line somewhere.
Anyway, since Labour's conference starts next week, the Police have been gearing up a major security operation for the last few weeks. I'm sure they would appreciate people not documenting their efforts online, sufficed to say there are large concrete barriers everywhere there should be if you want to stop truck bombs, there is sufficient perimiter security to keep protestors and threats out of the building and a wide ranging reconnaisance has been conducted (remember that the IRA bomb in the Grand Hotel in the 80s was planted &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt; in advance). So Tony and his pals can rest safely, knowing that they are disrupting locals quite a lot and costing even more.
Today I was asked for ID to be let near the place to go into the carpark adjacent and I expect that from tomorrow that road will be closed entirely. What doesn't help is that there are roadworks going on on other major roads in Brighton, so traffic will be standing still for most of next week ;-)
Lucky I can park a mile away much cheaper and get a walk along the seafront first thing :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>GNOME Desktop progress</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/09/24/gnome-desktop-progress.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-09-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-09-24:/2004/09/24/gnome-desktop-progress.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macloco.net/blog/index.php?p=109"&gt;Craig is right&lt;/a&gt; that GNOME is still a way away from OS X for polish, integration and intuitivity, but it's nice that they have their sights aimed in those directions and development is going pretty fast these days - it definitely helps to have Novell bankrolling a lot of the work …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macloco.net/blog/index.php?p=109"&gt;Craig is right&lt;/a&gt; that GNOME is still a way away from OS X for polish, integration and intuitivity, but it's nice that they have their sights aimed in those directions and development is going pretty fast these days - it definitely helps to have Novell bankrolling a lot of the work (hopefully they will be beefing up the Ximian/Linux division development teams a lot).
It's not all as simple as catching Windows/OSX up though, everyone is trading features - Windows's next generation of interfaces are going to be bristling with shiny innovations lifted from OSX and open source apps, I bet ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Hero</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/09/24/hero.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-09-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-09-24:/2004/09/24/hero.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Movie poster" src="http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/60/36/38m.jpg"&gt;Hero is a tale of assassins and a lone officer of the law, set hundreds of years ago in China.

Jet Li plays the title role, Nameless, a local law official who has defeated several assassins bound to kill the King. He relates his tale in an audience with the King, with interesting consequences.
I can't really say anything else without giving the film away, but the plot is pretty good. What really shines about this film though is the visuals; It's definitely an art flick more than anything else. Colour is used very dramatically to convey a varying sense of reality, which is actually quite crucial to understanding what's happening. You may notice what I'm talking about towards the end.
The action is superb too, with scenes ranging from swordplay on water (a very Crouching Tiger scene) to an archery assault the likes of which you can't even imagine, it's definitely varied and interesting, though it does lean predominantly towards sword fighting. You do have to suspend a lot of disbelief because physics has been utterly sacrificed in the name of visual effect. Also largely done away with is continuity of motion between shots, also it seems in the name of making it look prettier and this felt quite jarring at times.
Overall I can't recommend this film enough - if you liked Crouching Tiger you'll definitely like Hero, and if you didn't then this might have enough frenetic action to keep you interested :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Gallery returns</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/09/23/gallery-returns.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-09-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-09-23:/2004/09/23/gallery-returns.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's the tenshu.net picture gallery back again on an Internet near you.

The soundtrack is excellent, the animation is superb, the 3D rendering is exquisite, the cinematography is great...technically this is a superb film. It does fall squarely into the category of extremely strange Japanese anime though. The original movie was also pretty strange, but it was possible to follow the plot and it made sense; The sequel, however, is an impenetrable fortress of strangeness on the first watch. I probably need to see it a couple more times so I can get the visuals and subtitles all taken in, especially since something was wrong with the subtitles we saw, with the odd phrase being repeated - at times it seemed like one person was having a conversation with themselves in two voices because only one mouth was moving. I'm not quite sure how much of it was the android characters not needing to move their mouths and how much of it was dodgy Internet subtitles ;-)
I'll get this on DVD as soon as they will let me, and update this with a second impression.
&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, so the film is way way way better with decent subs, albeit fan subs (which was no bad thing, they included a few translation notes that were very useful, like explanations of opaque Japanese proverbs). Excellent film, if you like anime at all you should see it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Infernal Affairs</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/09/23/infernal-affairs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-09-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-09-23:/2004/09/23/infernal-affairs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Movie poster" src="http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/64/74/48m.jpg"&gt;Sam is an organised crime boss and he has a plan.

They both want to win and they both know what the other is up to, and that is infiltrating their organisations with moles, so for an hour and a half you're wondering who's going to get found out and if they are actually a good or bad guy. This tension carries right up to the end and indeed beyond it (hurray for films that don't provide ultimate finality).
While there's very little actual action in this film, the suspense, script and acting will keep you engrossed to the end and maybe into the pre&amp;amp;sequels :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>tenshu.net is back!</title><link href="http://cmsj.net/2004/09/23/tenshunet-is-back.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2004-09-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T16:55:01+01:00</updated><author><name>Chris Jones</name></author><id>tag:cmsj.net,2004-09-23:/2004/09/23/tenshunet-is-back.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having said I wasn't going to put a blog back online I changed my mind and put this up, with piccie galleries to follow shortly.
