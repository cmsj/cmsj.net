    <p>Today I watched The Lord of The Rings: Return of The King: Extended Edition (bit of a mouthful) and I have to say I am very impressed and it's great to see things like the Saruman confrontation at last.
I've only watched a few of the extra bits, the ones I thought would be most interesting/funny and they were (the stuff about weta digital and post production was great) and I probably won't bother with the rest, it's just nice to have finally closed out the full, extended trilogy at last. I can still remember seeing Fellowship of The Ring quite clearly a few years ago and I've really enjoyed watching it develop since then.
I went for the boxed version, which includes a little model of Minas Tirith, which is very funky and goes with the Argonath from the Fellowship boxed version nicely :)</p>

    <p>Blimey. This is quite some intense action!
In a way it's more like playing Quake than it is Half Life - it feels even more intense than the original Half Life multiplayer deathmatch at least.
It's no Counterstrike:Source though, I am liking that game even more now, especially what with it running at &gt;50fps (my CPU doing SSE2 seems to make something of a large difference over similarly clocked 32bit Athlons)</p>

    <p>Last night I went to see Groove Armada at the Brixton Academy for marky's birthday. It was a truly excellent show - the performance was really spot on and they have done an excellent job preparing the tour so it's not just a string of set pieces; It was more like an arrangement of their work with the various tracks rolling through each other beautifully. The visuals were funky and the atmosphere was very friendly.
If you have the option of seeing them live, take it. I will be hunting the festival listings next year for their appearances ;)
(and thanks to Simon's parents for letting us stay the night, plus for having awesome cats :)</p>

    <p>I've disabled comments because they are filling up with spam. Sucks, but then this is the Internet, where people will take advantage of anything they can, just because they can. I'm not sure why anyone thinks that people reading about poker and fuck knows what else in my comments will make them part with their $$$, but the mentality of spammers is far far removed from that of normal people.</p>

    <p>I really didn't think it would go this smoothly at all, but I have just been playing Half Life 2 and Counterstrike:Source at pretty acceptable rates in <a href="http://www.transgaming.com/">Transgaming</a>'s Cedega. Woo!
It's a really impressive engine - realistic physics is definitely going to make games a load more fun :)</p>

    <p>Suck suck suck suck suck. That's how much a really sucky thing sucks. What sucks more than that is crap like <a href="http://www.grain.org/articles/?id=6">this</a>.
For those who don't read the link, the 4 word summary is "Operation Screw The Iraqis", this time by rewriting their constitution to place all sorts of insane legal restrictions on their agricultural industry and specifically the <em>seeds</em> they are allowed to use. I mean, come on, we've been doing this agriculture thing for thousands of years without needing large corporations to sell us infertile seeds we have to buy year after year.
In my opinion it is <em>sick</em> and amoral to do this kind of thing. I sincerely hope the new Iraqi government overturns <em>insane</em> orders like this, but I don't hold out a lot of hope given the amounts of money people stand to make :-/
As the article makes out, this is all about pleasing the WTO, which is a whole other rant I won't get into now, suffice to say, despite whatever good intentions they have, they suck too.</p>

    <p>If you are a Michael Caine fan, or like brit movies, or just generally like good old movies (or were young when it was released), you've probably seen the original Alfie, tale of a Jack The Lad character who cares only for himself and slowly becomes aware of the hurt this causes those around him.
Of course, the original is now too old to make any proper bank, so it's time to take a good idea and apply a thick layer of shiny mediocrity and remake it; and so they have, with Jude Law as a modern Alfie.
Law has the charm to pull off the kind of character Alfie is supposed to be, but I felt the film generally was quite hollow. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it didn't feel like it offered very much in the latter stages of the film - Alfie is learning the errors of his ways, but I just didn't care very much.
Also, the wardrobe people need firing, Alfie didn't have a single suit that was actually big enough for him. Your arms shouldn't bulge out wider than the shoulder pads!</p>

    <p>Last night I went to <a href="http://www.digintheribs.co.uk">Dig in the ribs</a> with a few friends and some 2-for-1 coupons. It's a Tex-Mex restaurant in Brighton's food quarter (a nice way of saying "that road with all the steak and chinese places" ;) that offers a fine array of meats and sauces.
I had a 16oz T-bone and brought a really feeble appetite with me, so I didn't make a very impressive dent in it, but Simon, Simon and Tam put in a good showing and tucked into a big plate of Nachos and sticky desserts too!
Well worth a visit, although the staff could have been a little more attentive, we waited about half an hour to pay the bill; It aids digestion though ;)</p>

Tonight I am going to an <a href="http://www.uglyduckling.us/">Ugly Duckling</a> gig in London! WOO! More when I've actually been ;)
<strong>Update:</strong> Wooo! UD rock live! They were unfortunately a little late arriving, so could only play for about an hour, but the set they did was fantastic - funky and funny. I strongly recommend you <a href="http://www.uglyduckling.us/sounds/">grab their albums/EPs</a>.</p>
