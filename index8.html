    <h2>Terminator Plugin HOWTO</h2>
<p>One of the features of the new 0.9x series of Terminator releases that hasn't had a huge amount of announcement/discussion yet is the plugin system. I've posted previously about the decisions that went into the design of the plugin framework, but I figured now would be a good time to look at how to actually take advantage of it.
While the plugin system is really generic, so far there are only two points in the Terminator code that actually look for plugins - the Terminal context menu and the default URL opening code. If you find you'd like to write a plugin that interacts with a different part of Terminator, please let me know, I'd love to see some clever uses of plugins and I definitely want to expand the number of points that plugins can hook into.
The basics of a plugin</p>
<hr>
<p>A plugin is a class in a .py file in terminatorlib/plugins or ~/.config/terminator/plugins, but not all classes are automatically treated as plugins. Terminator will examine each of the .py files it finds for a list called 'available' and it will load each of the classes mentioned therein.
Additionally, it would be a good idea to import terminatorlib.plugin as that contains the base classes that other plugins should be derived from.
A quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">terminatorlib.plugin</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">plugin</span>
<span class="n">available</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;myfirstplugin&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">myfirstplugin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">plugin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SomeBasePluginClass</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So now let's move on to the simplest type of plugin currently available in Terminator, a URL handler.
URL Handlers</p>
<hr>
<p>This type of plugin adds new regular expressions to match text in the terminal that should be handled as URLs. We ship an example of this with Terminator, it's a handler that adds support for the commonly used format for Launchpad. Ignoring the comments and the basics above, this is ultimately all it is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="n">LaunchpadBugURLHandler</span>(<span class="n">plugin</span>.<span class="n">URLHandler</span>):
  <span class="n">capabilities</span> = [<span class="s">&#39;url_handler&#39;</span>]
  <span class="n">handler_name</span> = <span class="s">&#39;launchpad_bug&#39;</span>
  <span class="nb">match</span> = <span class="s">&#39;\\b(lp|LP):?\s?#?[0-9]+(,\s*#?[0-9]+)*\\b&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">  </span><span class="nv">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">callback</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">self</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">item</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">re</span>.<span class="nv">findall</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="nv">r</span><span class="s1">&#39;[0-9]+&#39;</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="ss">)</span>:
<span class="w">      </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="ss">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/%s&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">item</span><span class="ss">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That's it! Let's break it down a little to see the important things here:
-   inherit from plugin.URLHandler if you want to handle URLs.
-   include 'url_handler' in your capabilities list
-   URL handlers must specify a unique handler_name (no enforcement of uniqueness is performed by Terminator, so use some common sense with the namespace)
-   Terminator will call a method in your class called callback() and pass it the text that was matched. You must return a valid URL which will probably be based on this text.</p>
<p>and that's all there is to it really. Next time you start terminator you should find the pattern you added gets handled as a URL!
Context menu items</p>
<hr>
<p>This type of plugin is a little more involved, but not a huge amount and as with URLHandler we ship an example in terminatorlib/plugins/custom_commands.py which is a plugin that allows users to add custom commands to be sent to the terminal when selected. This also brings a second aspect of making more complex plugins - storing configuration. Terminator's shiny new configuration system (based on the excellent ConfigObj) exposes some API for plugins to use for loading and storing their configuration. The nuts and bolts here are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">terminatorlib.plugin</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">plugin</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">terminatorlib.config</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Config</span>
<span class="n">available</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;CustomCommandsMenu&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CustomCommandsMenu</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">plugin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MenuItem</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="n">capabilities</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;terminal_menu&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">None</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Config</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">myconfig</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plugin_get_config</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__class__</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># Now extract valid data from sections{}</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">menuitems</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">menu</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">terminal</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">menuitems</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">gtk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MenuItem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;some jazz&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a pretty simplified example, but it's sufficient to insert a menu item that says "some jazz". I'm not going to go into the detail of hooking up a handler to the 'activate' event of the MenuItem or other PyGTK mechanics, but this gives you the basic detail. The method that Terminator will call from your class is again "callback()" and you get passed a list you should add your menu structure to, along with references to the main menu object and the related Terminal. As the plugin system expands and matures I'd like to be more formal about the API that plugins should expect to be able to rely on, rather than having them poke around inside classes like Config and Terminal. Suggestions are welcome :)
Regarding the configuration storage API - the value returned by Config.plugin_get_config() is just a dict, it's whatever is currently configured for your plugin's name in the Terminator config file. There's no validation of this data, so you should pay attention to it containing valid data. You can then set whatever you want in this dict and pass it to Config().plugin_set_config() with the name of your class and then call Config().save() to flush this out to disk (I recommend that you be quite liberal about calling save()).
Wrap up</p>
<hr>
<p>Right now that's all there is to it. Please get in touch if you have any suggestions or questions - I'd love to ship more plugins with Terminator itself, and I can think of some great ideas. Probably the most useful thing would be something to help customise Terminator for heavy ssh users (see the earlier fork of Terminator called 'ssherminator')</p>

    <p>Ok folks, I suck for not getting Terminator 0.90 released earlier and I suck for not having a bunch of bug fixes for 0.14 in Ubuntu Lucid.
I'm going to fix both tonight by releasing 0.90 and begging the lovely Ubuntu Universe folks to grant an exception to get it into Lucid.
Here's hoping everything goes smoothly!</p>

    <p>For a while now I've been thinking about some ideas for a project that will require a scanner. No problem you think, scanners of various kinds have been supported in Linux for a long time.
I dislike ordering hardware online because of the shipping lag and because I'm a sucker for the retail experience, so I was checking out which devices would work with Ubuntu and which devices were on sale in my local computer supermarket. The latter was a depressingly short list, and the former was getting annoying to search for, but I stumbled on the idea of a multi-function printer. It turns out that it's cheaper to buy a scanner as part of a printer than it is to buy a scanner on its own (granted the resolution of the scanner isn't quite as good, but it's more than sufficient for my needs). The reason for this is undoubtedly that the manufacturers are expecting to make up their money by selling me ink cartridges every few months.
As I started to look at models of multi-function printers, one thing became apparent almost immediately - HP have done a lot of leg work on this. I quickly found a bunch of info on their site about how they basically support all of their stuff on Linux, including a page which specifically listed popular distros and which versions worked with which printers.
I decided pretty much immediately that I wanted to support this, so off I went to the shop to buy an HP. They had the decent looking F4580 for around £40, so I nabbed that and set off home.
When I got home I fired up my laptop running Lucid and plugged the new device in. Less than 10 seconds later I was told it was ready for printing, and I fired up Robert Ancell's excellent new Simple Scan to see what configuration I would need to do to make that work.... the answer being none, it scanned a page first time.
Now smug with the ease with which that had worked I started installing the HP driver software on a popular proprietary operating system so I could use it to configure the printer's WiFi feature (something I assumed I couldn't do from within Ubuntu - an assumption that turns out to have been wrong). Ten minutes later it was still finishing off the install process, but eventually I did get the printer hooked up to our wireless network.
Back to the Lucid machine, I told it to add a new printer, it immediately saw the HP announcing itself on the network and let me quickly add that and I could print over wifi. Pretty nifty stuff.
Then I started poking around with HP's Linux Imaging and Printing software (HPLIP) and noticed that there was an "hp-toolbox" that wasn't installed. This is the tool I should have used to configure the wifi network on the printer; It also shows the ink levels and lets you kick off scanning/printing/cleaning type jobs. Out of sheer curiosity I went into hp-toolbox's preferences and changed it from using xsane to simple-scan, and told it to start a Scan. I wasn't expecting it to work because the device wasn't connected via USB, but it turns out that not only does the device support scanning over WiFi, it works in Linux. It's not quite as fast as a direct hookup, but it's certainly significantly more convenient!
So there we have it, out of the box I was up and running within 10 seconds of plugging the device in, and if I'd known to just install hp-toolbox I would have had everything running wirelessly a few minutes later. This being compared to installing CDs and dealing with great gobs of driver/application mess (I've seen HP's Windows drivers and it's no fun trying to persuade them to update themselves, or to persuade them not to prompt you to register every week). A huge, epic victory for Linux and Ubuntu - and one that I seem to find with much random consumer hardware these days. A few years ago this post would have been full of complicated commands and scripts and compilation as I described how to make the device work, but now all I can do is be smug about how easy it was :D
Win.</p>

    <p>We've been hard at work over the last 7 months preparing a whole new core for Terminator and it's getting close to being ready, so this is a beta release intended for testing only. Ubuntu packages have been uploaded to our test PPA (<a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive/test">https://launchpad.net/~gnome-terminator/+archive/test</a>) and a tarball is available from <a href="http://mairukipa.tenshu.net/~cmsj/terminator/">http://mairukipa.tenshu.net/~cmsj/terminator/</a>.
Please provide any feedback about this release to our bug tracker at <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/">https://bugs.launchpad.net/terminator/</a> or our IRC channel, #terminator on irc.freenode.net.</p>
<p>Caveats:
  * config files from 0.14 and earlier are currently ignored by 0.90 because the config file format has changed.
  * we now have a very basic ability to save and restore layouts, but this feature is very new and likely to contain many bugs</p>

    <p>I'm done hacking on the Terminator epic-refactor branch for the evening and the following has been achieved today (in chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in handling URLs dropped on the window</li>
<li>Implement directional navigation</li>
<li>Implement geometry hinting</li>
<li>Fix a bug in group emitting that cause "Broadcast off" and "Broadcast to all" to become inverted</li>
<li>Implement WM_URGENT bell handler</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm <em>really</em> happy with how this is going. All that is left to have feature parity with trunk, I think, is some keyboard shortcut handlers.
I'd still love to get more testing results to make sure I haven't missed anything, but at this rate I'm expecting to be able to land the epic-refactor branch on trunk this weekend, after five and a half months.
Then I'm going to write a tool to convert old config files and we can think about putting out a 0.90 beta release. Exciting stuff!</p>

    <p>I managed to finish off what I thought were the last few missing keyboard shortcuts during my lunch break today, but then realised that I'd missed two, but I was so excited an short of time that I decided to just go ahead and land the branch anyway!
So there it is - trunk is now completely refactored and full of exciting new bugs. I noticed while I was working from it this afternoon that the transparency setting code wasn't working, but I expect I can get that cleared up tonight :)
Now a bunch of bug fixing and a config converter and we can release!
Thanks to everyone who has been testing so far.</p>
