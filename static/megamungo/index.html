<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a description of the steps needed to roll a cannabis cigarette using the "Mega Mungo Method".</p>
<p>The MMM doesn't require particularly advanced rolling skills, but can produce very good results nonetheless.</p>
<p>In this guide we use a selection of specialist tools/materials, your nearest hippy shop will have them in stock most likely.</p>
<p>The end result of the MMM is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. MMM cigarettes are a good length, typically thin girth and roughly conical in shape.</p>

<h2 id="Tools">Tools used</h2>
<p><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows the raw materials used to build the cigarette shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The diagram shows each part numbered, they are as follows:</p>
<ul title="Legend">
  <li>1 - Small pile of cannabis (skunk in this case)</li>
  <li>2 - Contents of one tobacco cigarette (Gauloises Blondes in this case)</li>
  <li>3 - Chopping board</li>
  <li>4 - Chopper</li>
  <li>5 - Rips skins</li>
  <li>6 - Rips filters</li>
  <li>7 - Ash tray</li>
  <li>8 - Blender bowl (for stash storage)</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously any cannabis and tobacco will do for this, skunk and Gauloises were selected out of personal preference.</p>

<h2 id="Stage1">Stage 1: Prepare the mixture</h2>
<p>Using the chopper and the chopping board, the tobacco and cannabis are mixed and then finely chopped (the cannabis was already coarsely chopped using the coffee grinding attachment of a typical kitchen blender). This stage is not necessary, however, the finer the mixture, the easier it is to fill/roll the skin later.</p>
<p><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows the finished mixture.</p>

<h2 id="Stage2">Stage 2: Prepare the skin</h2>
<p>A suitable length of skin is pulled from the Rips packet and torn off. In this case we have around 13/14 centimetres, which is roughly correct for the quantities in use here.</p>
<p>Several folds are made along the length of the skin next to shape the skin into a scoop so it can hold the mixture. To make these folds, hold the skin so that the gum strip runs along the top and is facing you, then fold the bottom edge towards you a few millimetres up (if you want to enhance the conical effect, the fold should be several millimetres larger at the right hand side than the left. About 3 such folds in slightly different positions will convince the skin to lie flat with the bottom part almost curled around, as shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Stage3">Stage 3: Prepare the roach</h2>
<p>Typically any thin cardboard will do as a roach. The MMM will work with just about any roach, but you will get better results if it is quite a sturdy roach, so we use Rips Filters. They come in pads of about 50 and one half has a bunch of perforations across it, allowing you to rip some off neatly to make the roach the right size for you.</p>
<p>Everyone does their roaches a different way, the MMM is very forgiving about the roach, but it should be as cylindrical as possible.</p>
<p>Now that you have your roach and skin prepared, you need to attach the two. Place the roach at the thin end of the cone shape in your skin and work the paper in to the coiled roach. Once in place, the roach will further shape the skin so that it looks like a half-rolled cigarette.</p>
<p><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows the skin with the roach attached.</p>

<h2 id="Stage4">Stage 4: Fill and roll</h2>
<p>You are now ready to start filling the cigarette. Grip the roach and twist/rotate it as necessary so the skin is shaped like a long half-pipe, now sprinkle the mixture in until the half-pipe is full. At this point, pat the mixture down slightly (a rail/underground ticket is good for this). All that is left is to roll, which can be done by rolling the roach end between your fingers and if necessary applying some pressure further up the length of the cigarette so it stays fairly tight.</p>
<p>Keep rolling until only the gummed edge is left, then lick it and roll the last few millimetres. You might need a little pressure on the gum'd edge to make it stick, depending on the quality of your skins.</p>
<p><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> shows the skin with roach and mixture in it, rolled and stuck down.</p>

<h2 id="Stage5">Stage 5: Finish off</h2>
<p>If you have any skin sticking out of the edge with the roach in, wave a lighter flame near it and it will burn away.</p>
<p>Since you only filled a half-pipe, you will have some mixture left - now that the cigarette is rolled, drop this through the open end. Placing a normal tobacco cigarette in the open end and bouncing the closed end on a table will help pat the mixture down and fill any air-gaps that have appeared.</p>
<p>Now twist off the open end. You might want to let the gum dry for a little while, or you'll get sideburn. Waving a lighter flame up and down the length of the cigarette will speed this process (be sure not to burn any holes part way up though!)</p>
<p>All that remains is to spark up, sit back and enjoy your handiwork :)</p>
